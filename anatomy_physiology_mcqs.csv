What may be said about the amount of energy in the form of infra-red electro- magnetic waves that is radiated from our bodies?,It depends on our body’s temperature.,It would be greater if our layer of subcutaneous fat was thicker.,It may be increased by contact between the body and an object with tem- perature lower than the body’s temperature,It may be increased by exposing more bare skin.,A,,,,,,,,,,,,

How does subcutaneous adipose tissue assist the body to regulate its temperature?,It conducts heat more readily than lean tissue so promotes heat loss.,It stores heat energy so acts like a “heat sink”.,It produces sweat for secretion via sweat glands.,It conducts heat less readily than lean tissue so insulates the body.,D,,,,,,,,,,,,
When is radiation an effective form of heat loss from the body?,When we expose a greater amount of bare skin.,When our body temperature is greater than that of our surroundings.,When blood vessels close to the body surface are vasoconstricted.,When our body temperature is less than that of our surroundings.,B,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which choice explains how the evaporation of sweat “cools” our body?,Evaporating water molecules carry with them more than the average amount of kinetic energy which leaves the remaining molecules with a lower aver-age kinetic energy.,The body loses more heat through the infrared radiation emitted by sweat than it gains from the infrared radiation emitted by the surroundings.,Sweat is at a lower temperature than our core body temperature so sweat on our skin cools us by conduction.,The water molecules in sweat are at a higher temperature than our core body temperature so losing sweat leaves us cooler due to the mass of water lost.,A,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why does an ice pack applied to a bruise reduce swelling?,Less ﬂ uid leaks from the bruise due to the diminished nerve impulses.,It causes vasoconstriction.,It reduces the metabolic rate at the local site.,It increases the viscosity of blood below the ice pack.,B,,,,,,,,,,,,
The skin is usually at a lower temperature than the body’s core temperature (37 °C). What is the reason for this?,The layer of adipose tissue in the hypodermis insulates the skin from the core temperature.,The sweating mechanism is able to lower the skin’s temperature.,Vasoconstriction restricts the amount of blood that is brought close to the skin surface.,"Heat loss through conduction, convection and radiation keeps the skin at a lower temperature.",C,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A person lightly dressed in shorts, shoes and a shirt is sitting on a cushioned chair in their shady backyard where the air temperature is 12 °C. There is no wind yet they feel uncomfortably cool. What is their major avenue of heat loss?",conduction,evaporation of sweat,radiation,convection,C,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why will the metal bell of a stethoscope that is at the room’s air temperature, produce the sensation of cold when placed on the patient’s skin?",The skin is at a lower temperature than the bell.,The stethoscope bell is a good conductor of heat.,The stethoscope bell is a poor conductor of heat.,Sweat evaporating from under the bell cools the skin.,B,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why does perspiring cause heat energy to be lost from the body? Because:,"being at a lower temperature than the skin, sweat cools skin by conduction.",evaporating water molecules remove heat in the form of their own kinetic energy.,the presence of sweat on the skin prevents infra-red radiation being absorbed.,sweat on the skin allows heat to be lost to the air by conduction.,B,,,,,,,,,,,,
In which situation will the skin lose heat by conduction to an object that is in contact with it? When the,object is a good conductor of heat.,skin is not covered by clothing.,object is a poor conductor of heat.,object is at a lower temperature than the skin,D,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which of the following is the most acceptable deﬁ nition of the term “power”?,the rate of doing work.,that which is stored and can be fully recovered and converted to kinetic energy.,the concept applied to that which gives an object the ability to do work.,the sum of an object’s potential and kinetic energies.,A,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which of the following correctly states the principle of conservation of energy in terms of the human body? (assume no foodstuffs are consumed and no urine or faeces are excreted).,"Q = s × m × ΔT (Q = energy, s = speciﬁ c heat of tissue, m = body mass, T = body temperature)",The energy stored in the human body is equal to the energy lost from the body plus the work done by the body.,The energy value of the food we eat must exceed the energy value of the muscular activity we perform.,The change in the energy stored in the body is equal to the heat lost from the body plus the work done by the body.,D,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which of the statements is a description of basal metabolic rate in a human?,The sum total of the energy released per minute by all of the chemical reac- tions that occur in the body.,the rate of energy utilisation during “absolute rest”.,The power generated by the body’s activities.,The oxygen consumption (in l/min) of an individual.,B,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which explanation of the cooling effect produced by an ice-pack when applied to the skin is the best one?,Cold applied to the skin causes vasodilation thus allowing more blood to pass through the tissue adjacent to the ice pack and be cooled.,"Heat withdrawn from the body is used to provide the ice with the latent heat of vaporisation it requires to melt, until melting is complete, the tempera- ture of the icepack remains constant. 20 Energy and Heat 509",Cold transfers along its temperature gradient – from ice pack to skin – the melting ice & water mixture ensures good contact with the skin.,"Heat withdrawn from the body (at 37 °C) is used to provide the ice (at 0 °C) with the latent heat of fusion it requires to melt, until melting is complete, the temperature of the icepack doesn’t rise appreciably.",D,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which is the correct distinction between temperature and heat?,Temperature is a measure of the amount of heat in an object and heat is the energy that ﬂ ows between objects which have different temperatures.,Heat is a measure of the energy contained within an object and temperature is the objective measurement of heat.,Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles and heat is the energy that ﬂ ows between objects as a result of a temperature difference.,Heat is the energy that ﬂ ows from a cold object to a hotter object and tem- perature measures the average random kinetic energy of the particles.,C,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A cold pack, applied to reduce swelling, is more effective if it contains melting ice at 0 °C rather than water at 0 °C. Why is this?",Because ice cools by conduction whereas water cools by convection.,Because initially the melting ice is colder than the cold water.,Because ice has a higher latent heat of vaporisation than water.,Because melting ice remains at 0 °C until it has all melted.,D,,,,,,,,,,,,
