"The hypothalamus and core thermoreceptors notice if body temp too low. The hypothalamus signals smooth muscle in blood vessels to vasoconstrict and skeletal muscle to shiver. This activity causes body temp to rise, which is again noticed by hypothalamus & core thermoreceptors, so the hypothalamus turns 120 off these heat gain mechanisms. In this scenario, which of the following state- ments is correct?",The scenario describes positive feedback in action.,The core thermoreceptors are the effector organs.,The hypothalamus is the control centre.,Skeletal muscle is the efferent pathway to the effector organ.,C
Some of the body’s homeostatic responses rely on “negative feedback”. Which of the following happens in negative feedback?,The body ignores changes in a physiological variable that are directed towards the set point for that variable.,The body ignores changes in a physiological variable that are directed away from the set point for that variable,The body’s response acts to oppose the change in the physiological variable.,The body’s response acts to enhance the change in the physiological variable,C
Synthesis and release of most hormones is regulated by negative feedback. Negative feedback means,A rise in hormone levels affects the target organ which acts to inhibit further hormone release,A rise in hormone levels affects the target organ which acts to stimulate further hormone release,The effect of hormones on target cells does not control further release of hormone,Neural stimuli result in the release of oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone from the hypothalamus,A
The hypothalamus produces “releasing hormones”. What do these releasing hormones do?,They direct the posterior pituitary to release hormones.,They direct the anterior pituitary to release hormones.,They direct the gonads to release hormones.,They act as “second messengers” when hormones bind to their receptor site.,B
Finish the sentence so that it is correct: A hormone may be deﬁ ned as a chemi- cal messenger that:,is released into circulation in small quantities.,facilitates communication between adjacent cells.,moves through extracellular ﬂ uid between cells of a single tissue,crosses the synaptic cleft and binds to a receptor.,A
In which part of the brain is the cardiovascular control centre located?,the neurohypophysis,the cerebrum,the hypothalamus,the medulla oblongata,D
Which of the following statements about the cardiovascular control centre of the brain is FALSE?,increased impulses along parasympathetic fibres causes vasoconstriction.,increased output along the sympathetic fibres INcrease heart rate.12.6 Blood Pressure and Its Control 310,output along of the parasympathetic fibres DEcreases heart rate.,decreased output along the sympathetic fibres causes dilation of arterioles.,A
Which of the following statements about the cardiovascular control centre of the brain is TRUE?,increased impulses along parasympathetic fibres causes vasoconstriction.,output along the sympathetic fibres INcrease heart rate.,output along the parasympathetic fibres INcrease heart rate.,output along the sympathetic fibres DEcrease heart rate.,B
The hypothalamus does ALL of the following EXCEPT one. Which one?,It is the autonomic control centre.,It directs lower CNS centres to perform actions.,"It produces the rigidly programmed, automatic behaviours necessary for survival",It performs many homeostatic roles.,C
"What part of the brain contains the autonomic control centre whose orders reg- ulate food intake, water balance and body temperature?",hypothalamus,thalamus,medulla oblongata,cerebellum,A
What is the role of the hypothalamus?,it receives sensory input and relays it to the cerebral cortex,it is the autonomic control centre which directs the function of the lower CNS,it uses past experience to analyse and act on sensory input,it integrates sensory information from association areas and performs abstract intellectual functions,B
A motor pathway in the autonomic nervous system consists of two neurons. Where does the second neuron start and ﬁ nish?,starts in the CNS and runs to the effector organ,starts in a ganglion and runs to the CNS,starts in a ganglion and runs to the effector organ,starts in the CNS and runs to a ganglion,C
Which is an example of a cholinergic receptor?,nicotinic receptor,adrenergic receptor 14 Nervous System 387,alpha receptor,beta receptor,A
