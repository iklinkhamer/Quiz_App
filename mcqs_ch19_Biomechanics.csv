Which of the following statements is characteristic of “third-class levers”?,the fulcrum lies between the effort and the load.,the muscular effort involved in shifting them exceeds the load that is shifted.,they are efﬁ cient levers.,the effort and the load are equally distant from the fulcrum.,B
"Levers are acted upon by forces known as the load, effort, and fulcrum. “First class” levers are characterised by having the:",effort located between the other two forces,load located between the other two forces,fulcrum located between the other two forces,the effort and the load on opposite sides of the fulcrum,C
Third class lever systems are always inefﬁ cient for which one of the following reasons?,the effort arm is longer than the load arm.,the effort force required is less than the load force.,the fulcrum lies between the effort and the load.,the load arm is longer than the effort arm.,D
Which of the following pairs of quantities does NOT contain a scalar quantity and a vector quantity?,mass and weight,traction and counter-traction,speed and velocity,distance and displacement,B
What is the meaning of ‘work’ in the scientiﬁ c sense?,An artist’s completed painting.,The amount of energy transferred between objects. 19 Biomechanics 486,The functions performed during the course of paid employment.,Sustained physical or mental activity.,B
In which of the following cases is the greatest amount of work being done on the object that is experiencing the force?,"10,000 N is exerted on a wall for 30 s.",2000 N is used to raise an object by a height of 10 m.,5000 N is used to push an object a distance of 4 m.,1000 N is used to pull an object over 50 m.,D
"Traction forces may be represented by vectors. In Hamilton-Russell traction, which of the following vectors is equal in magnitude to the traction force?",The component of the patient’s weight that is perpendicular to the bed.,The component of the patient’s weight that is parallel to the bed.,The vector in A. subtracted from the patient’s weight.,The resulting vector when the vectors in A. and B. are added.,B
The magnitude of the traction force in a Hamilton-Russell traction is deter- mined by,The vector addition of the forces in the cords,The hanging mass multiplied by 9.8.,The component of the patient’s weight that is perpendicular to the bed.,The number of pulleys in the system.,A
What is one of the roles of the pulley in a traction system?,To supply the counter traction.,To enable the vector addition of forces.,To change the direction of the traction force,To prevent the hanging masses from resting on the ﬂ oor.,C
Energy may be deﬁ ned from the concepts of,force and heat.,heat and joules.,force and work.,work and temperature.,C
Which of the following statements about work is NOT correct?,More work occurs when a force acts over a small distance ( W = F ÷ s ),Simple machines allow us to perform work more easily.,Work (done on an object) is the amount of energy that transfers to that object.,It takes energy to perform work.,A
Work is done when an object is moved by a force. What is energy?,the capacity to do work.,the rate at which work is done.,a force that results in no movement.,the transformation of work from one form to another.,A
Which one of the following statements does NOT accurately describe energy?,Energy can be created but not destroyed.,The total amount of all types of energy remains constant.,The energy gained by an object is the amount of work done on the object.,Energy is the heat given out when oxidation occurs.,A
What may the ‘thermal energy’ of the particles in an object be deﬁ ned as?,the amount of heat that is contained in the object.,"sum of the random translational, rotational and vibrational kinetic energies.","sum of the random translational, rotational and vibrational kinetic energies and the work done to overcome the intermolecular forces.",average random kinetic energy of the particles.,B
Which of the following is the most acceptable deﬁ nition of the term “power”?,the rate of doing work.,that which is stored and can be fully recovered and converted to kinetic energy.,the concept applied to that which gives an object the ability to do work.,the sum of an object’s potential and kinetic energies.,A
