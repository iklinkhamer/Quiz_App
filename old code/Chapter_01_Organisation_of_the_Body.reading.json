  "title": "Organisation of the Body",
  "reading": "Anatomy studies body structure and the names and positions of parts; physiology studies how those parts function. The body can be described using standard anatomical position and directional terms (superior/inferior, anterior/posterior, medial/lateral, proximal/distal). Planes of section—sagittal, coronal, and transverse—help describe slices through the body. The trunk contains large cavities: the dorsal cavity (cranial and spinal) and the ventral cavity (thoracic and abdominopelvic). Organs are grouped into systems (e.g., musculoskeletal, nervous, cardiovascular). Levels of organisation progress from chemical → cellular → tissue → organ → system → organism. Homeostasis describes how variables such as temperature or blood pressure are maintained within narrow limits by negative feedback.",
