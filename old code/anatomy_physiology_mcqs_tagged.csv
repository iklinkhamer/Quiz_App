Which explanation of the cooling effect produced by an ice-pack when applied to the skin is the best one?,Cold applied to the skin causes vasodilation thus allowing more blood to pass through the tissue adjacent to the ice pack and be cooled.,"Heat withdrawn from the body is used to provide the ice with the latent heat of vaporisation it requires to melt, until melting is complete, the tempera- ture of the icepack remains constant. 20 Energy and Heat 509",Cold transfers along its temperature gradient – from ice pack to skin – the melting ice & water mixture ensures good contact with the skin.,"Heat withdrawn from the body (at 37 °C) is used to provide the ice (at 0 °C) with the latent heat of fusion it requires to melt, until melting is complete, the temperature of the icepack doesn’t rise appreciably.",D,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter 1 - Chemicals,0.989,Chapter 1 - Chemicals; Chapter 16 - Endocrine System; Chapter 2 - Classification,"by, is, of, the, to, when",,,0.000,,
Which is the correct distinction between temperature and heat?,Temperature is a measure of the amount of heat in an object and heat is the energy that ﬂ ows between objects which have different temperatures.,Heat is a measure of the energy contained within an object and temperature is the objective measurement of heat.,Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles and heat is the energy that ﬂ ows between objects as a result of a temperature difference.,Heat is the energy that ﬂ ows from a cold object to a hotter object and tem- perature measures the average random kinetic energy of the particles.,C,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter 1 - Chemicals,0.904,Chapter 1 - Chemicals,"and, heat, is, the",chapter_1::1_2_elements_and_atoms_heads_up,1.2 Elements and Atoms (Heads-up),0.971,chapter_1::1_2_elements_and_atoms_heads_up,"and, is, the"
"A cold pack, applied to reduce swelling, is more effective if it contains melting ice at 0 °C rather than water at 0 °C. Why is this?",Because ice cools by conduction whereas water cools by convection.,Because initially the melting ice is colder than the cold water.,Because ice has a higher latent heat of vaporisation than water.,Because melting ice remains at 0 °C until it has all melted.,D,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter 1 - Chemicals,0.992,Chapter 1 - Chemicals,"a, at, c, contain, is, to, water",chapter_1::1_2_elements_and_atoms_heads_up,1.2 Elements and Atoms (Heads-up),0.944,chapter_1::1_2_elements_and_atoms_heads_up; chapter_2::2_x_taxonomy_at_a_glance,"a, c, is"
