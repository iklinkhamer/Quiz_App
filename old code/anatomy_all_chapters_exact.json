Carbohy-\ndrates are a large and diverse group that includes sugars, starches, glycogen and cellulose.\nCarbohydrates in the diet supply an animal with much of its energy and in the animal’s\nbody, they transport and store energy.\nCarbohydrates are divided into three major groups based on size: monosaccharides (single\nsugars),disaccharides (double sugars) and polysaccharides (multi sugars).\nMonosaccharides are the smallest carbohydrate molecules. The most important monosac-\ncharide is glucose which supplies much of the energy in the cell. It consists of a ring of 6\ncarbon atoms with oxygen and hydrogen atoms attached.\nDisaccharides are formed when 2 monosaccharides join together. Sucrose (table sugar),\nmaltose, and lactose (milk sugar), are three important disaccharides. They are broken down\nto monosaccharides by digestive enzymes in the gut.\nPolysaccharides like starch, glycogen and cellulose are formed by tens or hundreds of\nmonosaccharides linking together.

Protein is also found as keratin in the\nskin, feathers and hair, in muscles, as well as in antibodies and some hormones.\nProteins are built up of long chains of smaller molecules called aminoacids . There are\n20 common types of amino acid and diﬀerent numbers of these arranged in diﬀerent orders\ncreate the multitude of individual proteins that exist in an animal’s body.\nLong chains of amino acids often link with other amino acid chains and the resulting protein\nmolecule may twist, spiral and fold up to make a complex 3-dimensional shape. As an\nexample, see the diagram of the protein lysozyme below. Believe it or not, this is a small\nand relatively simple protein.\nFigure6\n9\nChemicals\nIt is this shape that determines how proteins behave in cells, particularly when they are\nacting as enzymes. If for any reason this shape is altered, the protein stops working.

For example a cat can be a chat, a Katze, gato, katt, or a moggie, depending\non which language you use. To add to the confusion sometimes the same name is used\nfor diﬀerent animals. For example, the name ‘gopher’ is used for ground squirrels, rodents\n(pocket gophers), for moles and in the south-eastern United States for a turtle. This is\nthe reason why all animals have been given an oﬃcial scientiﬁc orbinomial name .\nUnfortunately these names are always in Latin. For example:\n•Common rat: Rattus rattus\n•Human: Homo sapiens\n•Domestic cat: Felis domesticus\n•Domestic dog: Canis familiaris\nAs you can see from the above there are certain rules about writing scientiﬁc names:\n•They always have 2parts to them.\n•The ﬁrst part is the genus name and is always written with a capital ﬁrst letter.\n•The second name is the species name and is always written in lowercase .\n•The name is always underlined or printed initalics .\n14\nClassiﬁcation Of Living Organisms\nThe ﬁrst time you refer to an organism you should write the whole name in full.

The method that has been agreed by biologists for doing this is called the classi-\nﬁcation system . The system is based on the assumption that the process of evolution\nhas, over the millennia, brought about slow changes that have converted simple one-celled\norganisms to complex multi-celled ones and generated the earth’s incredible diversity of life\nforms. The classiﬁcation system attempts to reﬂect the evolutionary relationships between\norganisms.\nInitially this classiﬁcation was based only on the appearance of the organism. However, the\ndevelopment of new techniques has advanced our scientiﬁc knowledge. The light microscope\nand later the electron microscope have enabled us to view the smallest structures, and now\ntechniques for comparing DNA have begun to clarify still further the relationships between\norganisms. In the light of the advances in knowledge the classiﬁcation has undergone\nnumerous revisions over time.\nAt present most biologists divide the living world into 5 kingdoms, namely:\n•bacteria\n•protists\n•fungi\n•plants\n•animal\nWe are concerned here almost entirely with the Animal Kingdom .

For instance all mammals have a similar skeleton,\nhair on their bodies, are warm bodied and suckle their young.\nThe class Mammalia (the mammals) contains 3 subclasses :\n•Duck billed platypus and the spiny anteater\n•Marsupials (animals like the kangaroo with pouches)\n•Truemammals (with a placenta)\nWithin the subclass containing the true mammals, there are groupings called orders that\ncontain mammals that are more closely similar or related, than others. Examples of six\nmammalian orders are given below:\n•Rodents (Rodentia) (rats and mice)\n•Carnivores (Carnivora) (cats, dogs, bears and seals)\n•Even-toed grazers (Artiodactyla) (pigs, sheep, cattle, antelopes)\n•Odd-toed grazers (Perissodactyla) (horses, donkeys, zebras)\n•Marine mammals (Cetacea) (whales, sea cows)\n•Primates (monkeys, apes, humans)\n17\nClassiﬁcation\nWithin each order there are various families .

This means\nthat all domestic cats belong to the species Felis domesticus , because all breeds of cat\nwhether Siamese, Manx or ordinary House hold cat can cross breed. However, domestic\ncats can not mate successfully with lions, tigers or jaguars, so these are placed in separate\nspecies, e.g. Felis leo, Felis tigris and Felis onca .\nEven within the same species, there can be animals with quite wide variations in appearance\nthat still breed successfully. We call these diﬀerent breeds, races orvarieties . For\nexample there are many diﬀerent breeds of dogs from Dalmatian to Chihuahua and of\ncats, from Siamese to Manx and domestic short-hairs, but all can cross breed. Often these\nbreeds have been produced by selectivebreeding but varieties can arise in the wild when\ngroups of animals are separated by a mountain range or sea and have developed diﬀerent\ncharacteristics over long periods of time.\nTo summarise, the classiﬁcation system consists of:\nTheAnimalKingdom which is divided into\nPhyla which are divided into\nClasses which are divided into\nOrders which are divided into\nFamilies which are divided into\nGenera which are divided into\nSpecies.\n“Kings Play Cricket On Flat Green Surfaces ” OR “Kindly Professors Cannot\nOftenFailGoodStudents ” are just two of the phrases students use to remind themselves\nof the order of these categories - on the other hand you might like to invent your own."

Some of the protein molecules form tiny channels in the membrane while others help\ntransport substances from one side of the membrane to the other.\n3.3.1 HowsubstancesmoveacrossthePlasmaMembrane\nSubstances need to pass through the membrane to enter or leave the cell and they do so in\na number of ways. Some of these processes require no energy i.e. they are passive, while\nothers require energy i.e. they are active .\nPassive processes include: a) diﬀusion and b) osmosis, while active processes include: c)\nactive transport, d) phagocytosis, e) pinocytosis and f) exocytosis. These will be described\nbelow.\n25\nThe Cell\nFigure15 Diagram3.5 : Diﬀusion in a liquid\na)Diﬀusion\nAlthough you may not know it, you are already familiar with the process of diﬀusion. It is\ndiﬀusion that causes a smell (expensive perfume or smelly socks) in one part of the room\nto gradually move through the room so it can be smelt on the other side. Diﬀusion occurs\nin the air and in liquids.\nDiagram 3.5 shows what happens when a few crystals of a dark purple dye called potassium\npermanganate are dropped into a beaker of water. The dye molecules diﬀuse into the water\nmoving from high to low concentrations so they become evenly distributed throughout the\nbeaker.\nIn the body, diﬀusion causes molecules that are in a high concentration on one side of the\ncell membrane to move across the membrane until they are present in equal concentrations\non both sides. It takes place because all molecules have an in-built vibration that causes\nthem to move and collide until they are evenly distributed. It is an absolutely natural\nprocess that requires no added energy.\nSmall molecules like oxygen, carbon dioxide, water and ammonia as well as fats, diﬀuse\ndirectly through the double fat layer of the membrane. The small molecules named above\nas well as a variety of charged particles (ions) also diﬀuse through the protein-lined channels.\nLarger molecules like glucose attach to a carrier molecule that aids their diﬀusion through\nthe membrane. This is called facilitateddiﬀusion .\n26\nThe Plasma Membrane\nIn the animal’s body diﬀusion is important for moving oxygen and carbon dioxide between\nthe lungs and the blood, for moving digested food molecules from the gut into the blood\nand for the removal of waste products from the cell.\nFigure16 Diagram3.6 : Osmosis\nb)Osmosis\nAlthough the word may be unfamiliar, you are almost certainly acquainted with the eﬀects\nof osmosis. It is osmosis that plumps out dried fruit when you soak it before making a\nfruit cake or makes that wizened old carrot look almost like new when you soak it in water.\nOsmosis is in fact the diﬀusion of water across a membrane that allows water across but\nnot larger molecules. This kind of membrane is called a semi-permeablemembrane .\nTake a look at side Aof diagram 3.6. It shows a container divided into two parts by\nan artiﬁcial semi-permeable membrane. Water is poured into one part while a solution\ncontaining salt is poured into the other part. Water can cross the membrane but the salt\ncannot. The water crosses the semi-permeable membrane by diﬀusion until there is an equal\namount of water on both sides of the membrane. The eﬀect of this would be to make the\nsalt solution more diluted and cause the level of the liquid in the right-hand side of the\ncontainer to rise so it looked like side Bof diagram 3.6. This movement of water across the\nsemi-permeable membrane is called osmosis. It is a completely natural process that requires\nno outside energy.\nAlthough it would be diﬃcult to do in practice, imagine that you could now take a plunger\nand push down on the ﬂuid in the right-hand side of container Bso that it ﬂowed back\nacross the semi-permeable membrane until the level of ﬂuid on both sides was equal again.\nIf you could measure the pressure required to do this, this would be equal to the osmotic\n27\nThe Cell\npressure of the salt solution. (This is a rather advanced concept at this stage but you will\nmeet this term again when you study ﬂuid balance later in the course).\nFigure17 Diagram3.7 : Osmosis in red cells placed in a hypotonic solution\nThe plasma membrane of cells acts as a semi-permeable membrane. If red blood cells, for\nexample, are placed in water, the water crosses the membrane to make the amount of water\non both sides of it equal (see diagram 3.7). This means that the water moves into the cell\ncausing it to swell. This can occur to such an extent that the cell actually bursts to release\nits contents. This bursting of red blood cells is called haemolysis . In a situation such as\nthis when the solution on one side of a semi-permeable membrane has a lower concentration\nthan that on the other side, the ﬁrst solution is said to be hypotonic to the second.\nFigure18 Diagram3.8 : Osmosis in red cells placed in a hypertonic solution\nNow think what would happen if red blood cells were placed in a salt solution that has\na higher salt concentration than the solution within the cells (see diagram 3.8). Such a\nbathing solution is called a hypertonic solution. In this situation the “concentration” of\nwater within the cells would be higher than that outside the cells. Osmosis (diﬀusion of\nwater) would then occur from the inside of the cells to the outside solution, causing the\ncells to shrink.\n28\nThe Plasma Membrane\nFigure19 Diagram3.9 : Red cells placed in an isotonic solution\nA solution that contains 0.9% salt has the same concentration as body ﬂuids and the solution\nwithin red cells. Cells placed in such a solution would neither swell nor shrink (see diagram\n3.9). This solution is called an isotonic solution. This strength of salt solution is often\ncallednormalsaline and is used when replacing an animal’s body ﬂuids or when cells like\nred blood cells have to be suspended in ﬂuid.\nRemember - osmosis is a special kind of diﬀusion. It is the diﬀusion of water molecules\nacross a semi-permeable membrane. It is a completely passive process and requires no\nenergy.\nSometimes it is diﬃcult to remember which way the water molecules move. Although it\nis not strictly true in a biological sense, many students use the phrase “SALTSUCKS”\nto help them remember which way water moves across the membrane when there are two\nsolutions of diﬀerent salt concentrations on either side.\nAs we have seen water moves in and out of the cell by osmosis. All water movement from\nthe intestine into the blood system and between the blood capillaries and the ﬂuid around\nthe cells (tissue or extra cellular ﬂuid) takes place by osmosis. Osmosis is also important in\nthe production of concentrated urine by the kidney.\nc)Activetransport\n29\nThe Cell\nWhen a substance is transported from a low concentration to a high concentration i.e. uphill\nagainst the concentration gradient, energy has to be used. This is called activetransport\n.\nActive transport is important in maintaining diﬀerent concentrations of the ions sodium\nand potassium on either side of the nerve cell membrane. It is also important for removing\nvaluable molecules such as glucose, amino acids and sodium ions from the urine.\nFigure20 Diagram3.10 : Phagocytosis\nd)Phagocytosis\nPhagocytosis is sometimes called “cell eating”. It is a process that requires energy and is\nused by cells to move solid particles like bacteria across the plasma membrane. Finger-like\nprojections from the plasma membrane surround the bacteria and engulf them as shown\nin diagram 3.10. Once within the cell, enzymes produced by the lysosomes of the cell\n(described later) destroy the bacteria.\nThe destruction of bacteria and other foreign substance by white blood cells by the process\nof phagocytosis is a vital part of the defense mechanisms of the body.\ne)Pinocytosis\nPinocytosis or “cell drinking” is a very similar process to phagocytosis but is used by cells\nto move ﬂuids across the plasma membrane. Most cells carry out pinocytosis (note the\npinocytotic vesicle in diagram 3.3).\nf)Exocytosis\n30\nThe Cytoplasm\nExocytosis is the process by means of which substances formed in the cell are moved through\nthe plasma membrane into the ﬂuid outside the cell (or extra-cellular ﬂuid). It occurs in\nall cells but is most important in secretory cells (e.g. cells that produce digestive enzymes)\nand nerve cells."

Many of the reactions that take place in the cell occur in the\ncytosol.\n3.4.2 b)Cellinclusions\nThese are large particles of fat, glycogen and melanin that have been produced by the cell.\nThey are often large enough to be seen with the light microscope. For example the cells of\nadipose tissue (as in the insulating fat layer under the skin) contain fat that takes up most\nof the cell.\n3.4.3 c)Organelles\nOrganelles are the “little organs” of the cell - like the heart, kidney and liver are the organs\nof the body. They are structures with characteristic appearances and speciﬁc “jobs” in the\ncell. Most can not be seen with the light microscope and so it was only when the electron\nmicroscope was developed that they were discovered. The main organelles in the cell are the\nribosomes,endoplasmicreticulum,mitochondrion,Golgicomplex andlysosomes\n. A cell containing these organelles as seen with the electron microscope is shown in diagram\n3.3.\nRibosomes\nFigure21 Diagram3.11 : Rough endoplasmic reticulum\nRibosomes are tiny spherical organelles that make proteins by joining amino acids to-\ngether. Many ribosomes are found free in the cytosol, while others are attached to the\nrough endoplasmic reticulum.\n31\nThe Cell\nEndoplasmicreticulum\nTheendoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of membranes that form channels\nthroughout the cytoplasm from the nucleus to the plasma membrane. Various molecules\nare made in the ER and transported around the cell in its channels. There are two types\nof ER: smooth ER and rough ER.\nSmoothER is where the fats in the cell are made and in some cells, where chemicals\nlike alcohol, pesticides and carcinogenic molecules are inactivated.\nTheRoughER has ribosomes attached to its surface. The function of the Rough ER is\ntherefore to make proteins that are modiﬁed stored and transported by the ER (Diagram\n3.11).\nMitochondria\nFigure22 Diagram3.12 : A mitochondrion\nMitochondria (singular mitochondrion) are oval or rod shaped organelles scattered\nthroughout the cytoplasm. They consist of two membranes, the inner one of which is\nfolded to increase its surface area. (Diagram 3.12)\nMitochondria are the “power stations” of the cell. They make energy by “burning” food\nmolecules like glucose. This process is called cellularrespiration . The reaction requires\noxygen and produces carbon dioxide which is a waste product. The process is very com-\nplex and takes place in a large number of steps but the overall word equation for cellular\nrespiration is-\nGlucose+oxygen=carbondioxide+water+energy\nNote that cellular respiration is diﬀerent from respiration or breathing. Breathing is the\nmeans by which air is drawn into and expelled from the lungs. Breathing is necessary to\nsupply the cells with the oxygen required by the mitochondria and to remove the carbon\ndioxide produced as a waste product of cellular respiration.\nActive cells like muscle, liver, kidney and sperm cells have large numbers of mitochondria.\nGolgiApparatus\nFigure23 Diagram3.13 : A Golgi body\n32\nThe Nucleus\nTheGolgi bodies in a cell together make up the Golgi apparatus . Golgi bodies are\nfound near the nucleus and consist of ﬂattened membranes stacked on top of each other\nrather like a pile of plates (see diagram 3.13). The Golgi apparatus modiﬁes and sorts the\nproteins and fats made by the ER, then surrounds them in a membrane as vesicles so they\ncan be moved to other parts of the cell.\nLysosomes\nLysosomes are large vesicles that contain digestive enzymes. These break down bacteria\nand other substances that are brought into the cell by phagocytosis or pinocytosis. They\nalso digest worn-out or damaged organelles, the components of which can then be recycled\nby the cell to make new structures.\n3.4.4 d)MicroﬁlamentsAndMicrotubules\nSome cells can move and change shape and organelles and chemicals are moved around the\ncell. Threadlike structures called microﬁlaments andmicrotubules that can contract\nare responsible for this movement.\nThese structures also form the projections from the plasma membrane known as ﬂagella\n(singular ﬂagellum) as in the sperm tail, and cilia found lining the respiratory tract and\nused to remove mucus that has trapped dust particles (see chapter 4).\nMicrotubules also form the pair of cylindrical structures called centrioles found near the\nnucleus. These help organise the spindle used in cell division."

These diﬀerent types\nof cells are not just scattered around randomly but similar cells that perform the same\nfunction are arranged in groups. These collections of similar cells are known as tissues .\nThere are four main types of tissues in animals. These are:\n44\nThe Organisation Of Animal Bodies\n•Epithelial tissues that form linings, coverings and glands,\n•Connective tissues for transport and support\n•Muscle tissues for movement and\n•Nervous tissues for carrying messages.\n4.2.1 EpithelialTissues\nEpithelium (plural epithelia) is tissue that covers and lines. It covers an organ or lines a\ntube or space in the body. There are several diﬀerent types of epithelium, distinguished by\nthe diﬀerent shapes of the cells and whether they consist of only a single layer of cells or\nseveral layers of cells.\nSimpleEpithelia-withasinglelayerofcells\nFigure29 Diagram4.1 : Squamous epithelium\nSquamousepithelium\nSquamous epithelium consists of a single layer of ﬂattened cells that are shaped rather like\n‘crazy paving’. It is found lining the heart, blood vessels, lung alveoli and body cavities\n(see diagram 4.1). Its thinness allows molecules to diﬀuse across readily.\n45\nBody Organisation\nFigure30 Diagram4.2 : Cuboidal epithelium\nCuboidalepithelium\nCuboidal epithelium consists of a single layer of cube shaped cells. It is rare in the body\nbut is found lining kidney tubules (see diagram 4.2). Molecules pass across it by diﬀusion,\nosmosis and active transport.\n46\nThe Organisation Of Animal Bodies\nFigure31 Diagram4.3 : Columnar epithelium\nColumnarepithelium\nColumnar epithelium consists of column shaped cells. It is found lining the gut from the\nstomach to the anus (see diagram 4.3). Digested food products move across it into the\nblood stream.\nFigure32 Diagram4.4 : Columnar epithelium with cilia\nColumnarepitheliumwithcilia\nColumnar epithelium with cilia on the free surface (also known as the apical side of the\ncell) lines the respiratory tract, fallopian tubes and uterus (see diagram 4.4). The cilia beat\nrhythmically to transport particles.\n47\nBody Organisation\nFigure33 Diagram4.5 : Transitional epithelium\nTransitionalepithelium-withavariablenumberoflayers\nThe cells in transitional epithelium can move over one another allowing it to stretch. It is\nfound in the wall of the bladder (see diagram 4.5).\nStratiﬁedepithelia-withseverallayersofcells\nFigure34 Diagram4.6 : Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium\nEpithelia with several layers of cells are found where toughness and resistance to abrasion\nare needed.\nStratiﬁedsquamousepithelium\nStratiﬁed squamous epithelium has many layers of ﬂattened cells. It is found lining the\nmouth, cervix and vagina. Cells at the base divide and push up the cells above them and\ncells at the top are worn or pushed oﬀ the surface (see diagram 4.6). This type of epithelium\nprotects underlying layers and repairs itself rapidly if damaged.\nKeratinisedstratiﬁedsquamousepithelium\nKeratinised stratiﬁed squamous epithelium has a tough waterproof protein called keratin\n48\nThe Organisation Of Animal Bodies\ndeposited in the cells. It forms the skin found covering the outer surface of mammals. (Skin\nwill be described in more detail in Chapter 5).\n4.2.2 ConnectiveTissues\nBlood, bone, tendons, cartilage, ﬁbrous connective tissue and fat (adipose) tissue are all\nclassed as connective tissues. They are tissues that are used for supporting the body or\ntransporting substances around the body. They also consist of three parts: they all have\ncells suspended in a ground substance or matrix and most haveﬁbres running through it.\nBlood\nBlood consists of a matrix - plasma, with several types of cells and cell fragments suspended\nin it. The ﬁbres are only evident in blood that has clotted. Blood will be described in detail\nin chapter 8.\nLymph\nLymph is similar in composition to blood plasma with various types of white blood cell\nﬂoating in it. It ﬂows in lymphatic vessels.\nConnectivetissue‘proper’\nFigure35 Diagram4.7 : Loose connective tissue\nConnective tissue ’proper’ consists of a jelly-like matrix with a dense network of collagen\nand elastic ﬁbres and various cells embedded in it. There are various diﬀerent forms of\n‘proper’ connective tissue (see 1, 2 and 3 below).\nLooseconnectivetissue\nLoose connective tissue is a sticky whitish substance that ﬁlls the spaces between organs.\nIt is found in the dermis of the skin (see diagram 4.7).\nDenseconnectivetissue\nDense connective tissue contains lots of thick ﬁbres and is very strong. It forms tendons,\nligaments and heart valves and covers bones and organs like the kidney and liver.\nAdiposetissue\nAdipose tissue consists of cells ﬁlled with fat. It forms the fatty layer under the dermis of\nthe skin, around the kidneys and heart and the yellow marrow of the bones.\nFigure36 Diagram4.8 : Cartilage\n49\nBody Organisation\nCartilage\nCartilage is the ‘gristle’ of the meat. It consists of a tough jelly-like matrix with cells\nsuspended in it. It may contain collagen and elastic ﬁbres. It is a ﬂexible but tough tissue\nand is found at the ends of bones, in the nose, ear and trachea and between the vertebrae\n(see diagram 4.8).\nBone\nBone consists of a solid matrix made of calcium salts that give it its hardness. Collagen\nﬁbres running through it give it its strength. Bone cells are found in spaces in the matrix.\nTwo types of bone are found in the skeleton namely spongy andcompactbone . They\ndiﬀer in the way the cells and matrix are arranged. (See Chapter 6 for more details of\nbone).\n4.2.3 MuscleTissues\nMuscle tissue is composed of cells that contract and move the body. There are three types\nof muscle tissue:\nFigure37 Diagram4.9 : Smooth muscle ﬁbres\n50\nThe Organisation Of Animal Bodies\nSmoothmuscle\nSmooth muscle consists of long and slender cells with a central nucleus (see diagram 4.9).\nIt is found in the walls of blood vessels, airways to the lungs and the gut. It changes the\nsize of the blood vessels and helps move food and ﬂuid along. Contraction of smooth muscle\nﬁbres occurs without the conscious control of the animal.\nFigure38 Diagram4.10 : Skeletal muscle ﬁbres\nSkeletalmuscle\nSkeletal muscle (sometimes called striated ,striped orvoluntarymuscle ) has striped\nﬁbres with alternating light and dark bands. It is attached to bones and is under the\nvoluntary control of the animal (see diagram 4.10).\nFigure39 Diagram4.11 : Cardiac muscle ﬁbres\n51\nBody Organisation\nCardiacmuscle\nCardiac muscle is found only in the walls of the heart where it produces the ‘heart beat’.\nCardiac muscle cells are branched cylinders with central nuclei and faint stripes (see diagram\n4.11). Each ﬁbre contracts automatically but the heart beat as a whole is controlled by the\npacemaker and the involuntary autonomicnervoussystem .\nFigure40 Diagram4.12 : A motor neuron\n4.2.4 NervousTissues\nNervous tissue forms the nerves, spinal cord and brain. Nerve cells or neurons consist of a\ncell body and a long thread or axon that carries the nerve impulse. An insulating sheath of\nfatty material ( myelin ) usually surrounds the axon. Diagram 4.12 shows a typical motor\nneuron that sends messages to muscles to contract."

For each one the structure of the organs involved will be described and the way they\nfunction will be explained.\nIn order to describe structures in the body of an animal it is necessary to have a system for\ndescribing the position of parts of the body in relation to other parts. For example it may\nbe necessary to describe the position of the liver in relation to the diaphragm, or the heart\nin relation to the lungs. Certainly if you work further with animals, in a veterinary clinic\nfor example, it will be necessary to be able to accurately describe the position of an injury.\nThe terms used for this are called directionalterms .\n58\nDirectional Terms\nThe most common directional terms are right andleft . However, even these are not\ncompletely straightforward especially when looking at diagrams of animals. The convention\nis to show the left side of the animal or organ on the right side of the page. This is the\nview you would get looking down on an animal lying on its back during surgery or in a\npost-mortem. Sometimes it is useful to imagine ‘getting inside’ the animal (so to speak) to\ncheck which side is which. The other common and useful directional terms are listed below\nand shown in diagram 4.16.\nTerm Deﬁnition Example\nDorsal Nearer the back of the animal\nthanThe backbone is dorsal to the\nbelly\nVentral Nearer the belly of the animal\nthanThe breastbone is ventral to\nthe heart\nCranial (or ante-\nrior)Nearer to the skull than The diaphragm is cranial to\nthe stomach\nCaudal (or poste-\nrior)Nearer to the tail than The ribs are caudal to the\nneck\nProximal Closer to the body than (only\nused for structures on limbs)The shoulder is proximal to\nthe elbow\nDistal Further from the body than\n(only used for structures on\nlimbs)The ankle is distal to the\nknee\nMedial Nearer to the midline than The bladder is medial to the\nhips\nLateral Further from the midline than The ribs are lateral to the\nlungs\nRostral Towards the muzzle There are more grey hairs in\nthe rostral part of the head\nPalmar The ”walking” surface of the\nfront pawThere is a small cut on the\nleft palmar surface\nPlantar The ”walking” surface of the\nhind pawThe pads are on the plantar\nside of the foot\nNote that we don’t use the terms superior andinferior for animals. They are only used\nto describe the position of structures in the human body (and possibly apes) where the\nupright posture means some structures are above or superior to others.\nIn order to look at the structure of some of the parts or organs of the body it may be\nnecessary to cut them open or even make thin slices of them that they can be examined\nunder the microscope. The direction and position of slices or sections through an animal’s\nbody have their own terminology.\nIf an animal or organ is sliced lengthwise this section is called a longitudinal orsagittal\nsection . This is sometimes abbreviated to LS.\nIf the section is sliced crosswise it is called a transverse orcross section .

They protect\nthe end of the toe and may be used for grasping, grooming, digging or in defense. They\nare continually worn away and grow continuously from a growth layer at their base (see\ndiagram 5.2).\nFigure47\nDiagram 5.2 - A carnivore’s claw\n64\nSkin Structures Made Of Keratin\nHoofs are found in sheep, cows, horses etc. otherwise known as ungulate mammals .\nThese are animals that have lost toes in the process of evolution and walk on the “nails” of\nthe remaining toes. The hoof is a cylinder of horny material that surrounds and protects\nthe tip of the toe (see diagram 5.3).\nFigure48\nDiagram 5.3 - A horse’s hoof\n5.3.2 HornsAndAntlers\nTrue horns are made of keratin and are found in sheep, goats and cattle. They are never\nbranched and, once grown, are never shed. They consist of a core of bone arising in the\ndermis of the skin and are fused with the skull. The horn itself forms as a hollow cone-shaped\nsheath around the bone (see diagram 5.4).\n65\nThe Skin\nFigure49\nDiagram 5.4 - A horn\nTheantlers of male deer have quite a diﬀerent structure. They are not formed in the\nepidermis and do not consist of keratin but are entirely of bone. They are shed each year\nand are often branched, especially in older animals. When growing they are covered in skin\ncalledvelvet that forms the bone. Later the velvet is shed to leave the bony antler. The\nvelvet is often removed artiﬁcially to be sold in Asia as a traditional medicine (see diagram\n5.5).\n66\nSkin Structures Made Of Keratin\nFigure50\nDiagram 5.5 - A deer antler\nOther animals have projections on their heads that are not true horns either. The horns\non the head of giraﬀes are made of bone covered with skin and hair, and the ‘horn’ of a\nrhinoceros is made of modiﬁed and fused hair-like structures.\n5.3.3 Hair\nHair is also made of keratin and develops in the epidermis. It covers the body of most\nmammals where it acts as an insulator and helps to regulate the temperature of the body\n(see below). The colour in hairs is formed from the same pigment, melanin that colours the\nskin. Coat colour may help camouﬂage animals and sometimes acts to attract the opposite\nsex.\n67\nThe Skin\nFigure51\nDiagram 5.6 - A hair\nHairs lie in afollicle and grow from a root that is well supplied with blood vessels. The\nhair itself consists of layers of dead keratin - containing cells and usually lies at a slant in\nthe skin. A small bundle of smooth muscle ﬁbres (the hairerectormuscle ) is attached\nto the side of each hair and when this contracts the hair stands on end. This increases the\ninsulating power of the coat and is also used by some animals to make them seem larger\nwhen confronted by a foe or a competitor(see diagram 5.6).\nThe whiskers of cats and the spines of hedgehogs are examples of special types of hairs.\n5.3.4 Feathers\nThe lightness and stiﬀness of keratin is also a key to bird ﬂight. In the form of feathers it\nprovides the large airfoils necessary for ﬂapping and gliding ﬂight. In another form, the light\nﬂuﬀy down feathers,also made of keratin, are some of the best natural insulators known.\nThis superior insulation is necessary to help maintain the high body temperatures of birds.\n68\nSkin Structures Made Of Keratin\nFigure52\nDiagram 5.7 - A Contour Feather\nCountour feathers are large feathers that cover the body, wings and tail. They have an\nexpandedvane that provides the smooth, continuous surface that is required for eﬀective\nﬂight. This surface is formed by barbs that extend out from the central shaft. If you look\ncarefully at a feather you can see that on either side of each barb are thousands of barbules\nthat lock together by a complex system of hooks and notches. if this arrangement becomes\ndisrupted, the bird uses its beak to draw the barbs and barbules together again in an action\nknown aspreening (see diagram 5.7).\n69\nThe Skin\nFigure53\nDiagram 5.8 - A Down Feather\n70\nSkin Glands\nFigure54\nDiagram 5.9 - A Pin Feather\nDown feathers are the only feathers covering a chick and form the main insulation layer\nunder the contour feathers of the adult. They have no shaft but consist of a spray of simple,\nslender branches (see diagram 5.8).\nPin feathers have a slender hair-like shaft often with a tiny tuft of barbs on the end. They\nare found between the other feathers and help tell a bird how its feathers are lying (see\ndiagram 5.9)."

Reptiles and birds have a dry skin with few glands.\nThepreengland , situated near the base of the bird’s tail, produces oil to help keep the\nfeathers in good condition. Mammals have an array of diﬀerent skin glands.

This secretion, known as\nsebum , keeps the hair supple and helps prevent the growth of bacteria (see diagram 5.6).\nSweat glands consist of a coiled tube and a duct leading onto the skin surface. Their\nappearance when examined under the microscope inspired one of the ﬁrst scientists to\nobserve them to call them “fairies’ intestines” (see diagram 5.1). Sweat contains salt and\nwaste products like urea and the evaporation of sweat on the skin surface is one of the major\nmechanisms for cooling the body of many mammals. Horses can sweat up to 30 litres of\nﬂuid a day during active exercise, but cats and dogs have few sweat glands and must cool\nthemselves by panting. Scent in the sweat of many animals is used to mark territory or\nattract the opposite sex.\nMammary glands are only present in mammals.

Amphibia (frogs) and reptiles are said to be” cold blooded\n” (poikilothermic ) because their body temperature approximately follows that of the\nenvironment. Birds and mammals are said to be warm blooded (homoiothermic )\nbecause they can maintain a roughly constant body temperature despite changes in the\ntemperature of the environment.\nHeat is produced by the biochemical reactions of the body (especially in the liver) and by\nmuscle contraction. Most of the heat loss from the body occurs via the skin. It is therefore\nnot surprising that many of the mechanisms for controlling the temperature of the body\noperate here.\n5.7.1 ReductionOfHeatLoss\nWhen an animal is in a cold environment and needs to reduce heat loss the erector muscles\ncontract causing the hair or feathers to rise up and increase the layer of insulating air\ntrapped by them (see diagram 5.11a).\nFigure56\nDiagram 5.11a) Hair muscle relaxed...............Diagram 5.11b) Hair muscle contracted\nHeat loss from the skin surface can also be reduced by the contraction of the abundant\nblood vessels that lie in the dermis. This takes blood ﬂow to deeper levels, so reducing heat\nloss and causing pale skin (see diagram 5.12a).\n74\nThe Skin And Temperature Regulation\nFigure57\nDiagram 5.12a) Reduction of heat loss by skin\nShivering caused by twitching muscles produces heat that also helps raise the body temper-\nature.\n5.7.2 IncreaseOfHeatLoss\nThere are two main mechanisms used by animals to increase the amount of heat lost from\nthe skin when they are in a hot environment or high levels of activity are increasing internal\nheat production. The ﬁrst is the expansion of the blood vessels in the dermis so blood ﬂows\nnear the skin surface and heat loss to the environment can take place. The second is by the\nproduction of sweat from the sweat glands (see diagram 5.12b). The evaporation of this\nliquid on the skin surface produces a cooling eﬀect.\nThe mechanisms for regulating body temperature are under the control of a small region of\nthe brain called the hypothalamus . This acts like a thermostat.\n75\nThe Skin\nFigure58\nDiagram 5.12b) - Increase of heat loss by skin\n5.7.3 HeatLossAndBodySize\nThe amount of heat that can be lost from the surface of the body is related to the area of\nskin an animal has in relation to the total volume of its body.\nSmall animals like mice have a very large skin area compared to their total volume. This\nmeans they tend to loose large amounts of heat and have diﬃculty keeping warm in cold\nweather. They may need to keep active just to maintain their body temperature or may\nhibernate to avoid the problem.\nLarge animals like elephants have the opposite problem. They have only a relatively small\nskin area in relation to their total volume and may have trouble keeping cool. This is one\nreason that these large animals tend to have sparse coverings of hair."

        "markdown": "Muscles make up the bulk of an animal’s body and account for about half its weight. The\nmeat on the chop or roast is muscle and is composed mainly of protein. The cells that make\nup muscle tissue are elongated and able to contract to a half or even a third of their length\nwhen at rest. There are three diﬀerent kinds of muscle based on appearance and function:\nsmooth, cardiac and skeletal muscle.\n7.2.1 TypesofMuscle\n•Smooth muscle\nSmooth or Involuntary muscle carries out the unconscious routine tasks of the body such\nas moving food down the digestive system, keeping the eyes in focus and adjusting the\ndiameter of blood vessels. The individual cells are spindle-shaped, being fatter in the\nmiddle and tapering oﬀ towards the ends with a nucleus in the centre of the cell. They\nare usually found in sheets and are stimulated by the non-conscious or autonomic nervous\nsystem as well as by hormones (see Chapter 3).\n•Cardiac muscle\nCardiac muscle is only found in the wall of the heart. It is composed of branching ﬁbres\nthat form a three-dimensional network. When examined under the microscope, a central\nnucleus and faint stripes or striations can be seen in the cells. Cardiac muscle cells contract\nspontaneously and rhythmically without outside stimulation, but the sinoatrial node (nat-\nural pacemaker) coordinates the heart beat. Nerves and hormones modify this rhythm (see\nChapter 3).\n•Skeletal muscle\nSkeletal muscle is the muscle that is attached to and moves the skeleton, and is under\nvoluntary control. It is composed of elongated cells or ﬁbres lying parallel to each other.\nEach cell is unusual in that it has several nuclei and when examined under the microscope\nappears striped or striated. This appearance gives the muscle its names of striped or striated\nmuscle. Each cell of striated muscle contains hundreds, or even thousands, of microscopic\nﬁbres each one with its own striped appearance. The stripes are formed by two diﬀerent\nsorts of protein that slide over each other making the cell contract (see diagram 7.1).\n102\nMuscles\nFigure83\nDiagram 7.1 - A striped muscle cell\n7.2.2 Musclecontraction\nMuscle contraction requires energy and muscle cells have numerous mitochondria. However,\nonly about 15% of the energy released by the mitochondria is used to fuel muscle contraction.\nThe rest is released as heat. This is why exercise increases body temperature and makes\nanimals sweat or pant to rid themselves of this heat.\nWhat we refer to as a muscle is made up of groups of muscle ﬁbres surrounded by connective\ntissue. The connective tissue sheaths join together at the ends of the muscle to form tough\nwhite bands of ﬁbre called tendons . These attach the muscles to the bones. Tendons\nare similar in structure to the ligaments that attach bones together across a joint (see\ndiagrams 7.2a and b).\n103\nMuscles\nFigure84\nDiagram 7.2 a and b - The structure of a muscle\nRemember:\nTendonsTie muscles to bones\nand\nLigamentsLink bones at joints\n7.2.3 Structureofamuscle\nA single muscle is fat in the middle and tapers towards the ends. The middle part, which\ngets fatter when the muscle contracts, is called the belly of the muscle. If you contract\nyour biceps muscle in your upper arm you may feel it getting fatter in the middle. You\nmay also notice that the biceps is attached at its top end to bones in your shoulder while\nat the bottom it is attached to bones in your lower arm. Notice that the bones at only one\nend move when you contract the biceps. This end of the muscle is called the insertion .\nThe other end of the muscle, the origin , is attached to the bone that moves the least (see\ndiagram 7.3).\n104\nMuscles\nFigure85\nDiagram 7.3 - Antagonistic muscles, ﬂexion and extension\n7.2.4 Antagonisticmuscles\nSkeletal muscles usually work in pairs. When one contracts the other relaxes and vice versa.\nPairs of muscles that work like this are called antagonistic muscles . For example the\nmuscles in the upper forearm are the biceps and triceps (see diagram 7.3). Together they\nbend the elbow. When the biceps contracts (and the triceps relaxes) the lower forearm\nis raised and the angle of the joint is reduced. This kind of movement is called ﬂexion .\nWhen the triceps is contracted (and the biceps relaxes), the angle of the elbow increases.\nThe term for this movement is extension .\nWhen you or animals contract skeletal muscle it is a voluntary action. For example, you\nmake a conscious decision to walk across the room, raise the spoon to your mouth or smile.\nThere is however, another way in which contraction of muscles attached to the skeleton\nhappens that is not under voluntary control. This is during a reﬂex action , such as\njerking your hand away from the hot stove you have touched by accident. This is called a\nreﬂexarc and will be described in detail in chapter 14-15.\n105\nMuscles"

This energy is needed to build large molecules\nlike proteins and glycogen, make the structures in cells, move chemicals through membranes\nand around cells, contract muscles, transmit nerve impulses and keep the body warm.\nAnimals get their energy from the large molecules that they eat as food. Glucose is often\nthe energy source but it may also come from other carbohydrates, as well as fats and protein.\nThe energy is made by the biochemical process known as cellularrespiration that takes\nplace in themitochondria inside every living cell.\nThe overall reaction can be summarised by the word equation given below.\nCharbohydrateFood(glucose)+Oxygen=CarbonDioxide+Water+energy\nAs you can see from this equation, the cells need to be supplied with oxygen andglucose\nand the waste product, carbondioxide , which is poisonous to cells, needs to be removed.\nThe way the digestive system provides the glucose for cellular respiration will be described\nin Chapter 11 (”The Gut and Digestion”), but here we are only concerned with the two\ngases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, that are involved in cellular respiration. These gases are\ncarried in the blood to and from the tissues where they are required or produced.\nOxygen enters the body from the air (or water in ﬁsh)and carbon dioxide is usually elimi-\nnated from the same part of the body. This process is called gasexchange . In ﬁsh gas\nexchange occurs in the gills, in land dwelling vertebrates lungs are the gas exchange organs\nand frogs use gills when they are tadpoles and lungs, the mouth and the skin when adults.\nMammals (and birds) are active and have relatively high body temperatures so they require\nlarge amounts of oxygen to provide suﬃcient energy through cellular respiration. In order\n112\nDiﬀusion And Transport Of Oxygen\nto take in enough oxygen and release all the carbon dioxide produced they need a very large\nsurface area over which gas exchange can take place. The many minute air sacs or alveoli\nof the lungs provide this. When you look at these under the microscope they appear rather\nlike bunches of grapes covered with a dense network of ﬁne capillaries (see diagram 9.1).\nA thin layer of water covers the inner surface of each alveolus. There is only a very small\ndistance -just 2 layers of thin cells - between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the\ncapillaries. The gases pass across this gap by diﬀusion ."

It therefore crosses the narrow barrier between the alveoli and the\ncapillaries to enter the blood and combine with the haemoglobin in the red blood cells to\nformoxyhaemoglobin .\nThe narrow diameter of the capillaries around the alveoli means that the blood ﬂow is\nslowed down and that the red cells are squeezed against the capillary walls. Both of these\nfactors help the oxygen diﬀuse into the blood (see diagram 9.2).\nWhen the blood reaches the capillaries of the tissues the oxygen splits from the haemoglobin\nmolecule.

        "markdown": "When air is breathed in it passes from the nose to the alveoli of the lungs down a series of\ntubes (see diagram 9.3). After entering the nose the air passes through the nasalcavity\n, which is lined with a moist membrane that adds warmth and moisture to the air as it\npasses. The air then ﬂows through the pharynx or throat, a passage that carries both\nfood and air, to the larynx where the voice-box is located. Here the passages for food and\nair separate again. Food must pass into the oesophagus and the air into the windpipe or\ntrachea . To prevent food entering this, a small ﬂap of tissue called the epiglottis closes\nthe opening during swallowing (see chapter 11). A reﬂex that inhibits breathing during\nswallowing also (usually) prevents choking on food.\nThe trachea is the tube that ducts the air down the throat. Incomplete rings of cartilage\nin its walls help keep it open even when the neck is bent and head turned. The fact that\nacrobats and people that tie themselves in knots doing yoga still keep breathing during the\nmost contorted manoeuvres shows how eﬀective this arrangement is. The air passage now\ndivides into the two bronchi that take the air to the right and left lungs before dividing\ninto smaller and smaller bronchioles that spread throughout the lungs to carry air to the\nalveoli. Smooth muscles in the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles adjust the diameter of\nthe air passages.\nThe tissue lining the respiratory passages produces mucus and is covered with minute hairs\norcilia. Any dust that is breathed into the respiratory system immediately gets entangled\nin the mucous and the cilia move it towards the mouth or nose where it can be coughed up\nor blown out."

        "title": "9.7 Breathing",
        "markdown": "Figure91 Diagram9.4a : Inspiration;Diagram9.4b : Expiration\nThe process of breathing moves air in and out of the lungs. Sometimes this process is\ncalledrespiration but it is important not to confuse it with the chemical process, cellular\nrespiration , that takes place in the mitochondria of cells. Breathing is brought about by\nthe movement of the diaphragm and the ribs.\n9.7.1 Inspiration\nThe diaphragm is a thin sheet of muscle that completely separates the abdominal and\nthoracic cavities. When at rest it domes up into the thoracic cavity but during breathing\nin orinspiration it ﬂattens. At the same time special muscles in the chest wall move the\nribs forwards and outwards. These movements of both the diaphragm and the ribs cause\nthe volume of the thorax to increase. Because the pleural cavities are airtight, the lungs\nexpand to ﬁll this increased space and air is drawn down the trachea into the lungs (see\ndiagram 9.4a).\n9.7.2 Expiration\nExpiration or breathing out consists of the opposite movements. The ribs move down\nand in and the diaphragm resumes its domed shape so the air is expelled (see diagram\n9.4b). Expiration is usually passive and no energy is required (unless you are blowing up a\nballoon).\n115\nRespiratory System\n9.7.3 LungVolumes\nFigure92 Diagram9.5 : Lung volumes\nAs you sit here reading this just pay attention to your breathing. Notice that your in and out\nbreaths are really quite small and gentle (unless you have just rushed here from somewhere\nelse!). Only a small amount of the total volume that your lungs hold is breathed in and\nout with each breath. This kind of gentle “at rest” breathing is called tidal breathing\nand the volume breathed in or out (they should be the same) is the tidal volume (see\ndiagram 9.5). Sometimes people want to measure the volume of air inspired or expired\nduring a minute of this normal breathing. This is called the minutevolume . It could be\nestimated by measuring the volume of one tidal breath and then multiplying that by the\nnumber of breaths in a minute. Of course it is possible to take a deep breath and breathe\nin as far as you can and then expire as far as possible. The volume of the air expired when\na maximum expiration follows a maximum inspiration is called the vital capacity (see\ndiagram 9.5).\n9.7.4 CompositionOfAir\nThe air animals breathe in consists of 21% oxygen and 0.04% carbon dioxide. Expelled air\nconsists of 16% oxygen and 4.4% carbon dioxide. This means that the lungs remove only\na quarter of the oxygen contained in the air. This is why it is possible to give someone (or\nan animal) artiﬁcial respiration by blowing expired air into their mouth.\nBreathing is usually an unconscious activity that takes place whether you are awake or\nasleep, although, humans at least, can also control it consciously. Two regions in the\nhindbrain called the medullaoblongata andpons control the rate of breathing. These\nare calledrespiratory centres . They respond to the concentration of carbon dioxide\n116\nSummary\nin the blood. When this concentration rises during a bout of activity, for example, nerve\nimpulses are automatically sent to the diaphragm and rib muscles that increase the rate\nand the depth of breathing. Increasing the rate of breathing also increases the amount of\noxygen in the blood to meet the needs of this increased activity.\n9.7.5 TheAcidityOfTheBloodAndBreathing\nThe degree of acidity of the blood (the acid-basebalance) is critical for normal functioning\nof cells and the body as a whole. For example, blood that is too acidic or alkaline can\nseriously aﬀect nerve function causing a coma, muscle spasms, convulsions and even death.\nCarbon dioxide carried in the blood makes the blood acidic and the higher the concentration\nof carbon dioxide the more acidic it is. This is obviously dangerous so there are various\nmechanisms in the body that bring the acid-base balance back within the normal range.\nBreathing is one of these homeostatic mechanisms. By increasing the rate of breathing the\nanimal increases the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide that is expelled from the blood.\nThis reduces the acidity of the blood.\n9.7.6 BreathingInBirds\nBirds have a unique respiratory system that enables them to respire at the very high rates\nnecessary for ﬂight. The lungs are relatively solid structures that do not change shape and\nsize in the same way as mammalian lungs do. Tubes run through them and connect with\na series of air sacs situated in the thoracic and abdominal body cavities and some of the\nbones. Movements of the ribs and breastbone or sternum expand and compress these air\nsacs so they act rather like bellows and pump air through the lungs. The evolution of this\nextremely eﬃcient system of breathing has enabled birds to migrate vast distances and ﬂy\nat altitudes higher than the summit of Everest."

Lymph is a clear watery ﬂuid that is very similar\nto blood plasma except that it contains large numbers of white blood cells, mostly lympho-\ncytes . It also contains protein, cellular debris, foreign particles and bacteria. Lymph that\ncomes from the intestines also contains many fat globules following the absorption of fat\nfrom the digested food into the lymphatics ( lacteals ) of the villi (see chapter 11 for more\non these). From the lymph capillaries the lymph ﬂows into larger tubes called lymphatic\nvessels. These carry the lymph back to join the blood circulation (see diagrams 10.1 and\n10.2).\nFigure94\nDiagram 10.1 - A capillary bed with lymphatic capillaries\n121\nLymphatic System\n10.2.1 Lymphaticvessels\nLymphatic vessels have several similarities to veins. Both are thin walled and return ﬂuid\nto the right hand side of the heart. The movement of the ﬂuid in both is brought about\nby the contraction of the muscles that surround them and both have valves to prevent\nbackﬂow. One important diﬀerence is that lymph passes through at least one lymphnode\nor gland before it reaches the blood system (see diagram 10.2). These ﬁlter out used cell\nparts, cancer cells and bacteria and help defend the body from infection.\nLymph nodes are of various sizes and shapes and found throughout the body and the\nmore important ones are shown in diagram 10.3. They consist of lymph tissue surrounded\nby a ﬁbrous sheath. Lymph ﬂows into them through a number of incoming vessels. It\nthen trickles through small channels where white cells called macrophages (derived from\nmonocytes ) remove the bacteria and debris by engulﬁng and digesting them (see diagram\n10.4). The lymph then leaves the lymph nodes through outgoing vessels to continue its\njourney towards the heart where it rejoins the blood circulation (see diagrams 10.2 and\n10.3).\nFigure95\nDiagram 10.2 - The lymphatic system\nFigure96\nDiagram 10.3 - The circulation of lymph with major lymph nodes\n122\nLymphatic System\nFigure97\nDiagram 10.4 - A lymph node\nAs well as ﬁltering the lymph, lymph nodes produce the white cells known as lymphocytes\n. Lymphocytes are also produced by the thymus ,spleen andbonemarrow . There are\ntwo kinds of lymphocyte. The ﬁrst attach invading micro organisms directly while others\nproduceantibodies that circulate in the blood and attack them.\nThe function of the lymphatic system can therefore be summarized as transport and de-\nfense. It is important for returning the ﬂuid and proteins that have escaped from the blood\ncapillaries to the blood system and is also responsible for picking up the products of fat\ndigestion in the small intestine. Its other essential function is as part of the immune system,\ndefending the body against infection.\n10.2.2 Problemswithlymphnodesandthelymphaticsystem\nDuring infection of the body the lymph nodes often become swollen and tender because\nof their increased activity. This is what causes the swollen ‘glands’ in your neck during\nthroat infections, mumps and tonsillitis. Sometimes the bacteria multiply in the lymph\nnode and cause inﬂammation. Cancer cells may also be carried to the lymph nodes and\nthen transported to other parts of the body where they may multiply to form a secondary\ngrowth ormetastasis . The lymphatic system may therefore contribute to the spread of\ncancer. Inactivity of the muscles surrounding the lymphatic vessels or blockage of these\nvessels causes tissue ﬂuid to ‘back up’ in the tissues resulting in swelling or oedema .\n123\nLymphatic System"

To give\nthe micro- organisms access to the cellulose molecules, the plant cell walls need to be broken\ndown. This is why herbivores have teeth that are adapted to crush and grind.

Some mammals,\ne.g. hamsters, have stretchy cheek pouches that they use to carry food or material to make\ntheir nests.\nThe sight or smell of food and its presence in the mouth stimulates the salivaryglands\nto secretesaliva . There are four pairs of these glands in cats and dogs (see diagram 11.3).\nThe ﬂuid they produce moistens and softens the food making it easier to swallow. It also\ncontains the enzyme, salivaryamylase , which starts the digestion of starch.\nThetongue moves food around the mouth and rolls it into a ball for swallowing. Taste\nbuds are located on the tongue and in dogs and cats it is covered with spiny projections\nused for grooming and lapping. The cow’s tongue is prehensile and wraps around grass to\ngraze it.\nSwallowing is a complex reﬂex involving 25 diﬀerent muscles.

At the centre of the tooth is a space ﬁlled with pulp which contains\nblood vessels and nerves. The tooth is cemented into the socket and in most teeth the\ntip of the root is quite narrow with a small opening for the blood vessels and nerves (see\ndiagram 11.5).\nIn teeth that grow continuously, like the incisors of rodents, the opening remains large and\nthese teeth are called openrootedteeth . Mammals have 2 distinct sets of teeth. The\nﬁrst themilkteeth are replaced by the permanentteeth .\n133\nThe Gut and Digestion\nFigure103\nDiagram 11.5 - Structure of a tooth\n11.9.1 TypesOfTeeth\nAll the teeth of ﬁsh and reptiles are similar but mammals usually have four diﬀerent types\nof teeth.\nTheincisors are the chisel-shaped ‘biting oﬀ’ teeth at the front of the mouth. In rodents\nand rabbits the incisors never stop growing (open-rooted teeth). They must be worn or\nground down continuously by gnawing. They have hard enamel on one surface only so they\nwear unevenly and maintain their sharp cutting edge.\nThe largest incisors in the animal kingdom are found in elephants, for tusks are actually\ngiant incisors. Sloths have no incisors at all, and sheep have no incisors in the upper jaw\n(see diagram 11.6). Instead there is a horny pad against which the bottom incisors cut.\nThecanines or ‘wolf-teeth’ are long, cone-shaped teeth situated just behind the incisors.\nThey are particularly well developed in the dog and cat families where they are used to\nhold, stab and kill the prey (see diagram 11.7).\nThe tusks of boars and walruses are large canines while rodents and herbivores like sheep\nhave no (or reduced) canines. In these animals the space where the canines would normally\nbe is called the diastema . In rodents like the rat and beaver it allows the debris from\ngnawing to be expelled easily.\n134\nTeeth\nThe cheek teeth or premolars andmolars crush and grind the food. They are particularly\nwell developed in herbivores where they have complex ridges that form broad grinding\nsurfaces (see diagram 11.6). These are created from alternating bands of hard enamel and\nsofter dentine that wear at diﬀerent rates.\nIn carnivores the premolars and molars slice against each other like scissors and are called\ncarnassial teeth see diagram 11.7). They are used for shearing ﬂesh and bone.\n11.9.2 DentalFormula\nThe numbers of the diﬀerent kinds of teeth can be expressed in a dentalformula . This\ngives the numbers of incisors, canines, premolars and molars in onehalf of the mouth. The\nnumbers of these four types of teeth in the left orrighthalfoftheupperjaw are written\nabove a horizontal line and the four types of teeth in the right orlefthalfofthelower\njaw are written below it.\nThus the dental formula for the sheep is:\n0.0.3.3\n3.1.3.3\nIt indicates that in the upper right (or left) half of the jaw there are no incisors or canines\n(i.e. there is adiastema ), three premolars and three molars.

Their digested bodies provide the ruminant with\nthe majority of its protein requirements.\nIn the wild grazing is a dangerous activity as it exposes the herbivore to predators. They\ncrop the grass as quickly as possible and then when the animal is in a safer place the food\nin the rumen can be regurgitated to be chewed at the animal’s leisure. This is ‘chewing the\ncud’ orrumination . The ﬁnely ground food may be returned to the rumen for further\nwork by the microorganisms or, if the particles are small enough, it will pass down a special\ngroove in the wall of the oesophagus straight into the omasum.

To prevent this\nhappening various mechanisms come into play as soon as the concentration of the blood\nincreases. A part of the brain called the hypothalamus is in charge of these homeostatic\nprocesses. The most important is the feeling of thirst that is triggered by an increase in\nblood concentration. This stimulates an animal to ﬁnd water and drink it.\nThe kidneys are also involved in maintaining water balance as various hormones instruct\nthem to produce more concentrated urine and so retain some of the water that would\notherwise be lost (see later in this Chapter and Chapter 16).\n151\nUrinary System\n12.4.1 DesertAnimals\nCoping with water loss is a particular problem for animals that live in dry conditions. Some,\nlike the camel, have developed great tolerance for dehydration. For example, under some\nconditions, camels can withstand the loss of one third of their body mass as water. They\ncan also survive wide daily changes in temperature. This means they do not have to use\nlarge quantities of water in sweat to cool the body by evaporation.\nSmaller animals are more able than large ones to avoid extremes of temperature or dry\nconditions by resting in sheltered more humid situations during the day and being active\nonly at night.\nThe kangaroo rat is able to survive without access to any drinking water at all because it\ndoes not sweat and produces extremely concentrated urine.

Together the glomerulus and capsule act as a blood-\n156\nKidney Tubules Or Nephrons\nﬁltering device (see diagram 12.7). The holes in the ﬁlter allow most of the contents of\nthe blood through except the redand white cells and large protein molecules. The ﬂuid\nﬂowing from the capsule into the rest of the kidney tubule is therefore very similar to blood\nplasma and contains many useful substances like water, glucose, salt and amino acids. It\nalso contains waste products like urea .\n12.7.1 ProcessesOccurringInTheNephron\nAfter entering the glomerulus the ﬁltered ﬂuid ﬂows along a coiled part of the tubule (the\nproximalconvolutedtubule ) to a looped portion (the LoopofHenle ) and then to\nthecollecting tube via a second length of coiled tube (the distal convoluted tubule\n) (see diagram 12.6). From the collecting ducts the urine ﬂows into the renalpelvis and\nenters theureter .\nNote that the glomerulus, capsule and both coiled parts of the tubule are all situated in\nthe cortex of the kidney while the loops of Henle and collecting ducts make up the medulla\n(see diagram 12.5).\nAs the ﬂuid ﬂows along the proximal convoluted tubule useful substances like glucose, water,\nsalts, potassium ions, calcium ions and amino acids are reabsorbed into the blood capil-\nlaries that form a network around the tubules. Many of these substances are transported\nby active transport and energy is required.\nFigure122\nDiagram 12.7 - Filtration in the glomerulus and capsule\n157\nUrinary System\nIn a separate process, some substances, particularly potassium, ammonium and hydrogen\nions, and drugs like penicillin, are actively secreted into the distal convoluted tubule.\nBy the time the ﬂuid has reached the collecting ducts these processes of absorption and\nsecretion have changed the ﬂuid originally ﬁltered into the Bowman’s capsule into urine.\nThe main function of the collecting ducts is then to remove more water from the urine if\nnecessary. These processes are summarised in diagram 12.8.\nNormalurine consists of water, in which waste products such as urea and salts such as\nsodium chloride are dissolved. Pigments from the breakdown of red blood cells give urine\nits yellow colour.\n12.7.2 TheProductionOfConcentratedUrine\nBecause of the high pressure of the blood in the glomerulus and the large size of the pores in\nthe glomerulus/capsule-ﬁltering device, an enormous volume of ﬂuid passes into the kidney\ntubules. If this ﬂuid were left as it is, the animal’s body would be drained dry in 30 minutes.\nIn fact, as the ﬂuid ﬂows down the tubule, over 90% of the water in it is reabsorbed. The\nmain part of this reabsorption takes place in the collecting tubes.\nThe amount of water removed from the collecting ducts is controlled by a hormone called\nantidiuretichormone(ADH) produced by the pituitarygland , situated at the base\nof the brain. When the blood becomes more concentrated, as happens when an animal is\ndeprived of water, ADH is secreted and causes more water to be absorbed from the collecting\nducts so that concentrated urine is produced. When the animal has drunk plenty of water\nand the blood is dilute, no ADH is secreted and no or little water is absorbed from the\ncollecting ducts, so dilute urine is produced. In this way the concentration of the blood is\ncontrolled precisely.\n158\nWater Balance In Fish And Marine Animals\nFigure123\nDiagram 12.8 - Summary of the processes involved in the formation of urine"

This\nmeans each contains only half the chromosomes of the body cells ( haploid ). Fertilization\nresults in the joining of the male and female gametes to form a zygote which contains the\nfull number of chromosomes ( diploid ). The zygote then starts to divide by mitosis (see\nChapter 3) to form a new animal with all its body cells containing chromosomes that are\nidentical to those of the original zygote (see diagram 13.1).\nDiagram 13.1 - Sexual reproduction\nThe oﬀspring formed by sexual reproduction contain genes from both parents and show\nconsiderable variation. For example, kittens in a litter are all diﬀerent although they (usu-\nally) have the same mother and father. In the wild this variation is important because\nit means that when the environment changes some individuals may be better adapted to\nsurvive than others. These survivors pass their “superior” genes on to their oﬀspring. In\nthis way the characteristics of a group of animals can gradually change over time to keep\npace with the changing environment. This “survival of the ﬁttest” or “ naturalselection ”\nis the mechanism behind the theory of evolution ."

The reproductive organs of a male dog\nFigure127\nDiagram 13.3 - Diagram summarizing the functions of the male reproductive organs\n13.5.1 TheTestes\nSperm need temperatures between 2 to 10 degrees Centigrade lower and then the body\ntemperature to develop. This is the reason why the testes are located in a bag of skin called\nthescrotal sacs (orscrotum ) that hangs below the body and where the evaporation\nof secretions from special glands can further reduce the temperature. In many animals\n(including humans) the testes descend into the scrotal sacs at birth but in some animals they\ndo not descend until sexual maturity and in others they only descend temporarily during\nthe breeding season. A mature animal in which one or both testes have not descended is\ncalled acryptorchid and is usually infertile.\n170\nThe Male Reproductive System\nThe problem of keeping sperm at a low enough temperature is even greater in birds that\nhave a higher body temperature than mammals. For this reason bird’s sperm are usually\nproduced at night when the body temperature is lower and the sperm themselves are more\nresistant to heat.\nThe testes consist of a mass of coiled tubes (the seminiferous orsperm producing\ntubules ) in which the sperm are formed by meiosis (see diagram 13.4). Cells lying between\nthe seminiferous tubules produce the male sex hormone testosterone .\nWhen the sperm are mature they accumulate in the collectingducts and then pass to the\nepididymis before moving to the spermduct orvasdeferens . The two sperm ducts\njoin theurethra just below the bladder, which passes through the penis and transports\nboth sperm and urine.\nEjaculation discharges the semen from the erect penis. It is brought about by the con-\ntraction of the epididymis, vas deferens, prostate gland and urethra.\nFigure128\n171\nReproductive System\nDiagram 13.4 - The testis and a magniﬁed seminiferous tubule\n13.5.2 Semen\nSemen consists of 10% sperm and 90% ﬂuid and as sperm pass down the ducts from testis\nto penis, (accessory) glands add various secretion...\n13.5.3 AccessoryGlands\nThree diﬀerent glands may be involved in producing the secretions in which sperm are\nsuspended, although the number and type of glands varies from species to species.\nSeminalvesicles are important in rats, bulls, boars and stallions but are absent in cats\nand dogs. When present they produce secretions that make up much of the volume of the\nsemen, and transport and provide nutrients for the sperm.\nTheprostategland is important in dogs and humans. It produces an alkaline secretion\nthat neutralizes the acidity of the male urethra and female vagina.\nCowper’sglands (bulbourethral glands) have various functions in diﬀerent species. The\nsecretions may lubricate, ﬂush out urine or form a gelatinous plug that traps the semen\nin the female reproductive system after copulation and prevents other males of the same\nspecies fertilizing an already mated female. Cowper’s glands are absent in bears and aquatic\nmammals.\n13.5.4 ThePenis\nThe penis consists of connective tissue with numerous small blood spaces in it. These ﬁll\nwith blood during sexual excitement causing erection.\nPenisFormAndShape\nDogs, bears, seals, bats and rodents have a special bone in the penis which helps maintain\nthe erection (see diagram 13.2). In some animals (e.g. the bull, ram and boar) the penis has\nan “S” shaped bend that allows it to fold up when not in use. In many animals the shape\nof the penis is adapted to match that of the vagina. For example, the boar has a corkscrew\nshaped penis, there is a pronounced twist in bulls’ and it is forked in marsupials like the\nopossum. Some have spines, warts or hooks on them to help keep them in the vagina and\ncopulation may be extended to help retain the semen in the female system. Mating can\nlast up to three hours in minks, and dogs may “knot” or “tie” during mating and can not\nseparate until the erection has subsided.\n172\nThe Male Reproductive System\n13.5.5 Sperm\nSperm are made up of three parts: a head consisting mainly of the nucleus, a midpiece\ncontaining many mitochondria to provide the energy and a tail that provides propulsion\n(see diagram 13.5).\nFigure129\nDiagram 13.5 - A sperm\nA single ejaculation may contain 2-3 hundred million sperm but even in normal semen as\nmany as 10% of these sperm may be abnormal and infertile. Some may be dead while others\nare inactive or deformed with double, giant or small heads or tails that are coiled or absent\naltogether.\nWhen there are too many abnormal sperm or when the sperm concentration is low, the\nsemen may not be able to fertilize an egg and the animal is infertile. Make sure you don’t\nconfuse infertility with impotence, which is the inability to copulate successfully.\nSperm do not live forever. They have a deﬁnite life span that varies from species to species.\nThey survive for between 20 days (guinea pig) to 60 days (bull) in the epididymis but once\nejaculated into the female tract they only live from 12 to 48 hours. When semen is used for\nartiﬁcial insemination, storage under the right conditions can extend the life span of some\nspecies.\n13.5.6 ArtiﬁcialInsemination\nIn many species the male can be artiﬁcially stimulated to ejaculate and the semen collected.\nIt can then be diluted, stored and used to inseminate females. For example bull semen can\nbe diluted and stored for up to 3 weeks at room temperature. If mixed with an antifreeze\nsolution and stored in “straws” in liquid nitrogen at minus 79oC it will keep for much longer.\nUnfortunately the semen of chickens, stallions and boars can only be stored for up to 2\ndays.\nDilution of the semen means that one male can be used to fertilise many more females than\nwould occur under natural conditions. There are also advantages in the male and female\nnot having to make physical contact. It means that owners of females do not have to buy\n173\nReproductive System\nexpensive males and the possibility of transmitting sexually transmitted diseases is reduced.\nRoutine examination of the semen for sperm concentration, quality and activity allows only\nthe highest quality semen to be used so a high success rate is ensured.\nSince the lifespan of sperm in the female tract is so short and ova only survive from 8 to\n10 hours the timing of the artiﬁcial insemination is critical. Successful conception depends\nupon detecting the time that the animal is “on heat” and when ovulation occurs."

        "markdown": "The female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries that produce egg cells or ova\nandfallopiantubes where fertilisation occurs and which carry the fertilised ovum to the\nuterus . Growth of the foetus takes place here. The cervix separates the uterus from the\nvagina or birth canal, where the sperm are deposited (see diagram 13.6).\nFigure130\nDiagram 13.6. - The reproductive system of a female rabbit\nNote that primates like humans have a uterus with a single compartment but in most\nmammals the uterus is divided into two separate parts or horns as shown in diagram 13.6.\n174\nThe Female Reproductive Organs\n13.6.1 TheOvaries\nOvaries are small oval organs situated in the abdominal cavity just ventral to the kidneys.\nMost animals have a pair of ovaries but in birds only the left one is functional to reduce\nweight (see below).\nThe ovary consists of an inner region ( medulla ) and an outer region ( cortex ) containing\negg cells or ova. These are formed in large numbers around the time of birth and start\nto develop after the animal becomes sexually mature. A cluster of cells called the follicle\nsurrounds and nourishes each ovum.\n13.6.2 TheOvarianCycle\nTheovarian cycle refers to the series of changes in the ovary during which the follicle\nmatures, the ovum is shed and the corpusluteum develops (see diagram 13.7).\nNumerous undeveloped ovarian follicles are present at birth but they start to mature after\nsexual maturity. In animals that normally have only one baby at a time only one ovum will\nmature at once but in litter animals several will. The mature follicle consists of outer cells\nthat provide nourishment. Inside this is a ﬂuid-ﬁlled space that contains the ovum.\nA mature follicle can be quite large, ranging from a few millimetres in small mammals to\nthe size of a golf ball in large animals. It bulges out from the surface of the ovary before\neventually rupturing to release the ovum into the abdominal cavity. Once the ovum has\nbeen shed, a blood clot forms in the empty follicle. This develops into a tissue called\nthecorpus luteum that produces the hormone progesterone (see diagram 13.9). If\nthe animal becomes pregnant the corpus luteum persists, but if there is no pregnancy it\ndegenerates and a new ovarian cycle usually.\nFigure131\nDiagram 13.7 - The ovarian cycle showing from the top left clockwise: the maturation of\nthe ovum over time, followed by ovulation and the development of the corpus luteum in the\nempty follicle\n175\nReproductive System\n13.6.3 TheOvum\nWhen the ovum is shed the nucleus is in the ﬁnal stages of meiosis (cell division). It is\nsurrounded by few layers of follicle cells and a tough membrane called the zonapelluc ida\n(see diagram 13.8).\nFigure132\nDiagram 13.8 - An ovum\n13.6.4 TheOestrousCycle\nTheoestrouscycle is the sequence of hormonal changes that occurs through the ovarian\ncycle . These changes inﬂuence the behaviour and body changes of the female (see diagram\n13.9).\nFigure133\nDiagram 13.9 - The oestrous cycle\nThe ﬁrst hormone involved in the oestrous cycle is follicle stimulating hormone\n(F.S.H.), secreted by the anteriorpituitarygland (see chapter 16). It stimulates the\n176\nThe Female Reproductive Organs\nfollicle to develop. As the follicle matures the outer cells begin to secrete the hormone oe-\nstrogen and this stimulates the mammary glands to develop. It also prepares the lining of\nthe uterus to receive a fertilised egg. Ovulation is initiated by a surge of another hormone\nfrom the anterior pituitary, luteinisinghormone(L.H.). This hormone also inﬂuences\nthe development of the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone , a hormone that\nprepares the lining of the uterus for the fertilised ovum and readies the mammary glands\nfor milk production. If no pregnancy takes place the corpus luteum shrinks and the produc-\ntion of progesterone decreases. This causes FSH to be produced again and a new oestrous\ncycle begins.\nFor fertilisation of the ovum by the sperm to occur, the female must be receptive to the\nmale at around the time of ovulation. This is when the hormones turn on the signs of “ heat\n”, and she is “inseason ” or “inoestrous ”. These signs are turned oﬀ again at the end of\nthe oestrous cycle.\nDuring the oestrous cycle the lining of the uterus ( endometrium ) thickens ready for the\nfertilised ovum to be implanted. If no pregnancy occurs this thickened tissue is absorbed\nand the next cycle starts. In humans and other higher primates, however, the endometrium\nis shed as a ﬂow of blood and instead of an oestrous cycle there is a menstrualcycle .\nThe length of the oestrous cycle varies from species to species. In rats the cycle only lasts\n4-5 days and they are sexually receptive for about 14 hours. Dogs have a cycle that lasts\n60-70 days and heat lasts 7-9 days and horses have a 21-day cycle and heat lasts an average\nof 6 days.\nOvulation is spontaneous in most animals but in some, e.g. the cat, and the rabbit,\novulation is stimulated by mating. This is called inducedovulation .\n13.6.5 SignsOfOestrousOrHeat\n•When on heat a bitch has a blood stained discharge from the vulva that changes a little\nlater to a straw coloured one that attracts all the dogs in the neighbourhood.\n•Female cats “call” at night, roll and tread the carpet and are generally restless but will\n“stand” ﬁrm when pressure is placed on the pelvic region (this is the lordosis response).\n•A female rat shows the lordosis response when on heat. It will “mount” other females\nand be more active than normal.\n•A cow mounts other cows (bulling), bellows, is restless and has a discharge from the\nvulva.\n13.6.6 BreedingSeasonsAndBreedingCycles\nOnly a few animals breed throughout the year. This includes the higher primates (humans,\ngorillas and chimpanzees etc.), pigs, mice and rabbits. These are known as continuous\nbreeders .\nMost other animals restrict reproduction to one or two seasons in the year- seasonalbreed-\ners(see diagram 13.10). There are several reasons for this. It means the young can be born\nat the time (usually spring) when feed is most abundant and temperatures are favourable.\nIt is also sensible to restrict the breeding season because courtship, mating, gestation and\n177\nReproductive System\nthe rearing of young can exhaust the energy resources of an animal as well as make them\nmore vulnerable to predators.\nFigure134\nDiagram 13.10 - Breeding cycles\nThe timing of the breeding cycle is often determined by day length. For example the\nshortening day length in autumn will bring sheep and cows into season so the foetus can\ngestate through the winter and be born in spring. In cats the increasing day length after\nthe winter solstice (shortest day) stimulates breeding. The number of times an animal\ncomes into season during the year varies, as does the number of oestrous cycles during each\nseason. For example a dog usually has 2-3 seasons per year, each usually consisting of just\none oestrous cycle. In contrast ewes usually restrict breeding to one season and can continue\nto cycle as many as 20 times if they fail to become pregnant."

They swim through the\ncervix and uterus to the fallopian tubes moved along by whip-like movements of their tails\nand contractions of the uterus. During this journey the sperm undergo their ﬁnal phase of\nmaturation so they are ready to fertilise the ovum by the time they reach it in the upper\nfallopian tube.\n178\nPregnancy\nHigh mortality means only a small proportion of those deposited actually reach the ovum.\nThe sperm attach to the outer zona pellucida and enzymes secreted from a gland in the\nhead of the sperm dissolve this membrane so it can enter. Once one sperm has entered,\nchanges in thezonapellucida prevent further sperm from penetrating. The sperm loses\nits tail and the two nuclei fuse to form a zygote with the full set of paired chromosomes\nrestored.\n13.7.2 DevelopmentOfTheMorulaAndBlastocyst\nAs the fertilised egg travels down the fallopian tube it starts to divide by mitosis. First\ntwo cells are formed and then four, eight, sixteen, etc. until there is a solid ball of cells.\nThis is called a morula . As division continues a hollow ball of cells develops.

In later stages of development the embryo becomes\nknown as afoetus .\nThe placenta is the organ that attaches the foetus to the wall of the uterus. In it the blood\nof the foetus and mother ﬂow close to each other but never mix (see diagram 13.13). The\ncloseness of the maternal and foetal blood systems allows diﬀusion between them.

These\nmaintain the lining of the uterus and prepare the mammary glands for milk secretion. Later\nin the pregnancy the placenta itself takes over the secretion of these hormones.\nChorionic gonadotrophin is another hormone secreted by the placenta and placental\nmembranes. It prevents uterine contractions before labour and prepares the mammary\nglands for lactation. Towards the end of pregnancy the placenta and ovaries secrete relaxin\n, a hormone that eases the joint between the two parts of the pelvis and helps dilate the\ncervix ready for birth.\n13.8.3 PregnancyTesting\nThe easiest method of pregnancy detection is ultrasound which is noninvasive and very\nreliable Later in gestation pregnancy can be detected by taking x-rays.\nIn dogs and cats a blood test can be used to detect the hormone relaxin .\nIn mares and cows palpation of the uterus via the rectum is the classic way to determine\npregnancy. It can also be done by detecting the hormones progesterone orequinechori-\nonicgonagotrophin (eCG ) in the urine. A new sensitive test measures the amount of\nthe hormone,oestronesulphate , present in a sample of faeces. The hormone is produced\nby the foal and placenta, and is only present when there is a living foal.\nIn most animals, once pregnancy is advanced, there is a window of time during which an\nexperienced veterinarian can determine pregnancy by feeling the abdomen.\n181\nReproductive System\n13.8.4 GestationPeriod\nThe young of many animals (e.g. pigs, horses and elephants) are born at an advanced state\nof development, able to stand and even run to escape predators soon after they are born.\nThese animals have a relatively long gestation period that varies with their size e.g. from\n114 days in the pig to 640 days in the elephant.\nIn contrast, cats, dogs, mice, rabbits and higher primates are relatively immature when\nborn and totally dependent on their parents for survival. Their gestation period is shorter\nand varies from 25 days in the mouse to 31 days in rabbits and 258 days in the gorilla.\nThe babies of marsupials are born at an extremely immature stage and migrate to the pouch\nwhere they attach to a teat to complete their development. Kangaroo joeys, for example,\nare born 33 days after conception and opossums after only 8 days."

They need to be able to sense the temperature of their surroundings, for\nexample, so they can avoid the hot sun. They must also be able to identify food and escape\npredators.\nThe various systems and organs in the body must also be linked so they work together.\nFor example, once a predator has identiﬁed suitable prey it has to catch it. This involves\ncoordinating the contraction of the muscle so the predator can run, there must then be an\nincreased blood supply to the muscles to provide them with oxygen and nutrients. At the\nsame time the respiration rate must increase to supply the oxygen and remove the carbon\ndioxide produced as a result of this increased activity. Once the prey has been caught and\neaten, the digestive system must be activated to digest it.\nThe adjustment of an animal’s response to changes in the environment and the complex link-\ning of the various processes in the body that this response involves are called co-ordination\n. Two systems are involved in co-ordination in animals. These are the nervous anden-\ndocrine systems . The ﬁrst operates via electrical impulses along nerve ﬁbres and the\nsecond by releasing special chemicals or hormones into the bloodstream from glands."

Many axons have a sheath of fatty material called myelin\nsurrounding them. This speeds up the rate at which the nerve impulses travel along the\nnerve (see diagram 14.1).\nFigure141\nDiagram 14.1 - A motor neuron\nThe cell body of neurons is usually located in the brain or spinal cord while the axon extends\nthe whole distance to the organ that it supplies.

It happens without\nyou having to think about it. Animals automatically blink when an object approaches the\neye and cats twist their bodies in the air when falling so they land on their paws. (Please\ndon’t test this one at home with your pet cat!).\nSwallowing, sneezing, and the constriction of the pupil of the eye in bright light are also all\nreﬂex actions.\nThe path taken by the nerve impulses in a reﬂex is called a reﬂexarc . Most reﬂex arcs\ninvolve only three neurons (see diagram 14.4). The stimulus (a pin in the paw) stimulates\nthe pain receptors of the skin, which initiate an impulse in a sensory neuron. This travels\nto the spinal cord where it passes, by means of a synapse, to a connecting neuron called the\nrelay neuron situated in the spinal cord. The relay neuron in turn makes a synapse with one\nor more motor neurons that transmit the impulse to the muscles of the limb causing them to\ncontract and remove the paw from the sharp object. Reﬂexes do not require involvement of\nthe brain although you are aware of what is happening and can, in some instances, prevent\nthem happening. Animals are born with their reﬂexes.

        "markdown": "When we describe the nervous system of vertebrates we usually divide it into two parts (see\ndiagram 14.5).\n1. Thecentralnervoussystem (CNS ) which consists of the brain and spinal cord.\n2. Theperipheralnervoussystem (PNS ) which consists of the nerves that connect\nto the brain and spinal cord (cranial and spinal nerves) as well as the autonomic (or\ninvoluntary) nervous system.\n194\nParts of the Nervous System\nFigure145\nDiagram 14.5 - The nervous system of a horse\n14.6.1 TheCentralNervousSystem\nThecentralnervoussystem consists of the brain and spinal cord. It acts as a kind of\n‘telephone exchange’ where a vast number of cross connections are made.\nWhen you look at the brain or spinal cord some regions appear creamy white ( white\nmatter ) and others appear grey ( grey matter ). White matter consists of masses of\nnerve axons and the grey matter consists of the nerve cells. In the brain the grey matter is\non the outside and in the spinal cord it is on the inside (see diagram 14.2).\nTheBrain\nThe major part of the brain lies protected within the sturdy “box” of skull called the cra-\nnium . Surrounding the fragile brain tissue (and spinal cord) are protective membranes\ncalled themeninges (see diagram 14.6), and a crystal-clear ﬂuid called cerebrospinal\nﬂuid , which protects and nourishes the brain tissue. This ﬂuid also ﬁlls four cavities or\nventricles that lie within the brain.\nBrain tissue is extremely active and, even when an animal is resting, it uses up to 20% of\nthe oxygen taken into the body by the lungs. The carotidartery , a branch oﬀ the dorsal\naorta, supplies it with the oxygen and nutrients it requires. Brain damage occurs if brain\ntissue is deprived of oxygen for only 4-8 minutes.\n195\nNervous System\nThe brain consists of three major regions:\n1. thefore brain which includes the cerebral hemispheres ,hypothalamus and\npituitarygland ;\n2. thehindbrain orbrainstem , contains themedullaoblongata andpons and\n3. thecerebellum or “little brain” (see diagram 14.6).\nFigure146\nDiagram 14.6 - Longitudinal section through the brain of a dog\nMappingthebrain\nIn humans and some animals the functions of the diﬀerent regions of the cerebral cortex\nhave been mapped (see diagram 14.7).\nDiagram 14.7 - The functions of the regions of the human cerebral cortex\n196\nParts of the Nervous System\nTheForebrain\nThecerebralhemispheres are the masses of brain tissue that sit on the top of the brain.\nThe surface is folded into ridges and furrows called sulci (singular sulcus). They make\nthis part of the brain look rather like a very large walnut kernel. The two hemispheres are\nseparated by a deep groove although they are connected internally by a thick bundle of\nnerve ﬁbres. The outer layer of each hemisphere is called the cerebralcortex and this is\nwhere the main functions of the cerebral hemispheres are carried out.\nThe cerebral cortex is large and convoluted in mammals compared to other vertebrates and\nlargest of all in humans because this is where the so-called “higher centres” concerned with\nmemory, learning, reasoning and intelligence are situated.\nNerves from the eyes, ears, nose and skin bring sensory impulses to the cortex where they\nare interpreted. Appropriate voluntary movements are initiated here in the light of the\nmemories of past events.\nDiﬀerent regions of the cortex are responsible for particular sensory and motor functions,\ne.g. vision, hearing, taste, smell, or moving the fore-limbs, hind-limbs or tail. For example,\nwhen a dog sniﬀs a scent, sensory impulses from the organ of smell in the nose pass via the\nolfactory (smelling) nerve to the olfactory centres of the cerebral hemispheres where the\nimpulses are interpreted and co-ordinated.\nIn humans and some animals the functions of the diﬀerent regions of the cerebral cortex\nhave been mapped (see diagram 14.8).\nFigure147\nDiagram 14.8 - The functions of the regions of the cerebral cortex\nThehypothalamus is situated at the base of the brain and is connected by a “stalk”\nto thepituitary gland , the “master” hormone-producing gland (see chapter 16). The\nhypothalamus can be thought of as the bridge between the nervous and endocrine (hormone\n197\nNervous System\nproducing) systems. It produces some of the hormones that are released from the pituitary\ngland and controls the release of others from it.\nIt is also an important centre for controlling the internal environment of the animal and\ntherefore maintaining homeostasis. For example, it helps regulate the movement of food\nthrough the gut and the temperature, blood pressure and concentration of the blood. It is\nalso responsible for the feeling of being hungry or thirsty and it controls sleep patterns and\nsex drive.\nTheHindbrain\nThemedulla oblongata is at the base of the brain and is a continuation of the spinal\ncord. It carries all signals between the spinal cord and the brain and contains centres that\ncontrol vital body functions like the basic rhythm of breathing, the rate of the heartbeat\nand the activities of the gut. The medulla oblongata also co-ordinates swallowing, vomiting,\ncoughing and sneezing.\nTheCerebellum\nThecerebellum (little brain) looks rather like a smaller version of the cerebral hemispheres\nattached to the back of the brain. It receives impulses from the organ of balance (vestibular\norgan) in the inner ear and from stretch receptors in the muscles and tendons. By co-\nordinating these it regulates muscle contraction during walking and running and helps\nmaintain the posture and balance of the animal. When the cerebellum malfunctions it\ncauses a tremor and uncoordinated movement.\nTheSpinalCord\nThe spinal cord is a cable of nerve tissue that passes down the channel in the vertebrae\nfrom the hindbrain to the end of the tail. It becomes progressively smaller as paired spinal\nnerves pass out of the cord to parts of the body. Protective membranes or meninges cover\nthe cord and these enclose cerebral spinal ﬂuid (see diagram 14.9).\n198\nParts of the Nervous System\nFigure148\nDiagram 14.9 - The spinal cord\nIf you cut across the spinal cord you can see that it consists of white matter on the outside\nand grey matter in the shape of an H or butterﬂy on the inside.\n14.6.2 ThePeripheralNervousSystem\nTheperipheralnervoussystem consists of nerves that are connected to the brain ( cra-\nnial nerves ), and nerves that are connected to the spinal cord ( spinal nerves ). The\nautonomicnervous systemisalsopartoftheperipheralnervoussystem.\nCranialNerves\nThere are twelve pairs of cranial nerves that come from the brain. Each passes through\na hole in the cranium (brain case). The most important of these are the olfactory, optic,\nacoustic and vagus nerves.\nTheolfactorynerves - (smell) carry impulses from the olfactory organ of the nose to the\nbrain.\nTheopticnerves - (sight) carry impulses from the retina of the eye to the brain.\nTheauditory(acoustic)nerves - (hearing) carry impulses from the cochlear of the inner\near to the brain.\nThevagusnerve - controls the muscles that bring about swallowing. It also controls the\nmuscles of the heart, airways, lungs, stomach and intestines (see diagram 14.5).\n199\nNervous System\nSpinalNerves\nSpinal nerves connect the spinal cord to sense organs, muscles and glands in the body.\nPairs of spinal nerves leave the spinal cord and emerge between each pair of adjacent ver-\ntebrae (see diagram 14.9).\nThesciaticnerve is the largest spinal nerve in the body (see diagram 14.5). It leaves the\nspinal cord as several nerves that join to form a ﬂat band of nervous tissue. It passes down\nthe thigh towards the hind leg where it gives oﬀ branches to the various muscles of this\nlimb.\nTheAutonomicNervousSystem\nTheautonomic nervous system controls internal body functions that are not under\nconscious control. For example when a prey animal is chased by a predator the autonomic\nnervous system automatically increases the rate of breathing and the heartbeat. It dilates\nthe blood vessels that carry blood to the muscles, releases glucose from the liver, and\nmakes other adjustments to provide for the sudden increase in activity. When the animal\nhas escaped and is safe once again the nervous system slows down all these processes and\nresumes all the normal body activities like the digestion of food.\nThe nerves of the autonomic nervous system originate in the spinal cord and pass out be-\ntween the vertebrae to serve the various organs (see diagram 14.10).There are two main parts\nto the autonomic nervous system -- the sympatheticsystem and theparasympathetic\nsystem .\nThesympathetic system stimulates the “ﬂight, fright, ﬁght” response that allows an\nanimal to face up to an attacker or make a rapid departure. It increases the heart and\nrespiratory rates, as well as the amount of blood ﬂowing to the skeletal muscles while blood\nﬂow to less critical regions like the gut and skin is reduced. It also causes the pupils of the\neyes to dilate. Note that the eﬀects of the sympathetic system are similar to the eﬀects of\nthe hormone adrenaline (see Chapter 16).\nTheparasympatheticsystem does the opposite to the sympathetic system. It maintains\nthe normal functions of the relaxed body. These are sometimes known as the “housekeep-\ning” functions. It promotes eﬀective digestion, stimulates defaecation and urination and\nmaintains a regular heartbeat and rate of breathing.\n200\nSummary\nFigure149\nDiagram 14.10 - The function of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems"

These emerge from the epithelium on\n207\nThe Senses\nthe roof of the nose cavity into the mucus that lines it. As the animal breathes, chemicals\nin the air dissolve in the mucus. When the sense cell responds to a particular molecule, it\nﬁres an impulse that travels along the olfactorynerve to the brain where it is interpreted\nas an odour (see diagram 15.2).\nFigure154\nDiagram 15.2 - The olfactory organ - the sense of smell\nThe olfactory sense in humans is rudimentary compared to that of many animals. Carnivores\nthat hunt have a very highly developed sensitivity to scents. For example a polar bear can\nsmell out a dead seal 20 km away and a bloodhound can distinguish between the trails\nof diﬀerent people although it may sometimes be confused by the criss-crossing trail of\nidentical twins.\nSnakes and lizards detect odours by means of Jacobson’sorgan .

        "title": "15.9 Sight",
        "markdown": "The eyes are the organs of sight. They consist of spherical eyeballs situated in deep\ndepressions in the skull called the orbits . They are attached to the wall of the orbit by\nsix muscles, which move the eyeball. Upper and lower eyelids cover the eyes during sleep\nand protect them from foreign objects or too much light, and spread the tears over their\nsurface.\nThenictitatingmembrane orhaw is a transparent sheet that moves sideways across the\neye from the inner corner, cleansing and moistening the cornea without shutting out the\nlight. It is found in birds, crocodiles, frogs and ﬁsh as well as marsupials like the kangaroo.\nIt is rare in mammals but can be seen in cats and dogs by gently opening the eye when it\nis asleep.Eyelashes also protect the eyes from the sun and foreign objects.\n15.9.1 StructureoftheEye\nLining the eyelids and covering the front of the eyeball is a thin epithelium called the\nconjunctiva . Conjunctivitis is inﬂammation of this membrane. Tearglands that open\njust under the top eyelid secrete a salty solution that keeps the exposed part of the eye\nmoist, washes away dust and contains an enzyme that destroys bacteria.\n209\nThe Senses\nThe wall of the eyeball is composed of three layers (see diagram 15.4). From the outside\nthese are thesclera , thechoroid and theretina .\nFigure156\nDiagram 15.4 - The structure of the eye\nThesclera is a tough ﬁbrous layer that protects the eyeball and gives it rigidity. At the\nfront of the eye the sclera is visible as the “ white ” of the eye, which is modiﬁed as the\ntransparentcornea through which the light rays have to pass to enter the eye. The cornea\nhelps focus light that enters the eye.\nThechoroid lies beneath the sclera. It contains a network of blood vessels that supply\nthe eye with oxygen and nutrients. Its inner surface is highly pigmented and absorbs stray\nlight rays. In nocturnal animals like the cat and possum this highly pigmented layer reﬂects\nlight as a means of conserving light. This is what makes them shine when caught in car\nheadlights.\nAt the front of the eye the choroid becomes the iris . This is the coloured part of the eye\nthat controls the amount of light entering the pupil of the eye. In dim light the pupil is\nwide open so as much light as possible enters while in bright light the pupils contract to\nprotect the retina from damage by excess light.\nThepupil in most animals is circular but in many nocturnal animals it is a slit that can\nclose completely. This helps protect the extra-sensitive light sensing tissues of animals like\nthe cat and possum from bright sunlight.\nThe inner layer lining the inside of the eye is the retina . This contains the light sensing\ncells calledrods andcones (see diagram 15.5).\nTherodcells are long and fat and are sensitive to dim light but cannot detect colour. They\ncontain large amounts of a pigment that changes when exposed to light. This pigment comes\n210\nSight\nfrom vitamin A found in carrots etc. A deﬁciency of this vitamin causes night blindness.\nSo your mother was right when she told you to eat your carrots as they would help you see\nin the dark!\nTheconecells provide colour vision and allow animals to see details. Most are found in\nthe centre of the retina and they are most densely concentrated in a small area called the\nfovea . This is the area of sharpest vision, where the words you are reading at this moment\nare focussed on your retina.\nFigure157\nDiagram 15.5 - A rod and cone from the retina\n211\nThe Senses\nThe nerve ﬁbres from the cells of the retina join and leave the eye via the opticnerve .\nThere are no rods or cones here and it is a blindspot . The optic nerve passes through\nthe back of the orbit and enters the brain.\nThelens is situated just behind the pupil and the iris. It is a crystalline structure with\nno blood vessels and is held in position by a ligament. This is attached to a muscle, which\nchanges the shape of the lens so both near and distant objects can be focussed by the eye.\nThis ability to change the focus of the lens is called accommodation . In many mammals\nthe muscles that bring about accommodation are poorly developed, Rats, cows and dogs,\nfor example, are thought to be unable to focus clearly on near objects.\nIn old age and certain diseases the lens may become cloudy resulting in blurred vision. This\nis called acataract . Within the eyeball are two cavities, the anterior and posterior\nchambers , separated by the lens. They contain ﬂuids the aqueousandvitreoushu-\nmours respectively, that maintain the shape of the eyeball and help press the retina ﬁrmly\nagainst the choroid so clear images are seen.\n15.9.2 HowTheEyeSees\nEyes work quite like a camera. Light rays from an object enter the eye and are focused on\nthe retina (the “ﬁlm”) at the back of the eye. The cornea, the lens and the ﬂuid within the\neye all help to focus the light. They do this by bending the light rays so that light from the\nobject falls on the retina. This bending of light is called refraction . The light stimulates\nthe light sensitive cells of the retina and nerve impulses are produced that pass down the\noptic nerve to the brain (see diagram 15.6).\nFigure158\nDiagram 15.6 - How the light travels from the object to the retina of the eye\n212\nSight\n15.9.3 ColourVisionInAnimals\nAs mentioned before, the retina has two diﬀerent kinds of cells that are stimulated by light\n- rods and cones . In humans and higher primates like baboons and gorillas the rods\nfunction in dim light and do not perceive colour, while the cones are stimulated by bright\nlight and perceive details and colour.\nOther mammals have very few cones in their retinas and it is believed that they see no or\nonly a limited range of colour. It is, of course, diﬃcult to ﬁnd out exactly what animals\ndo see. It is thought that deer, rats, and rabbits and nocturnal animals like the cat are\ncolour-blind, and dogs probably see green and blue. Some ﬁsh and most birds seem to have\nbetter colour vision than humans and they use colour, often very vivid ones, for recognizing\neach other as well as for courtship and protection.\n15.9.4 BinocularVision\nAnimals like cats that hunt have eyes placed on the front of the head in such a way that\nboth eyes see the same wide area but from slightly diﬀerent angles (see diagram 15.7). This\nis called binocular vision . Its main advantage is that it enables the animals to\nestimatethedistancetothepreysotheycanchaseitandpounceaccurately.\nFigure159\nDiagram 15.7 - Well developed binocular vision in predator animals like the cat\nIn contrast plant-eating prey animals like the rabbit and deer need to have a wide panoramic\nview so they can see predators approaching. They therefore have eyes placed on the side of\nthe head, each with its own ﬁeld of vision (see diagram 15.8). They have only a very small\narea of binocular vision in front of the head but are extremely sensitive to movement.\n213\nThe Senses\nFigure160\nDiagram 15.8 - Panoramic monocular vision in prey animals like the rabbit"

        "markdown": "Animals use the sense of hearing for many diﬀerent purposes. It is used to sense danger\nand enemies, to detect prey, to identify prospective mates and to communicate within social\ngroups. Some animals (e.g. most bats and dolphins) use sound to “see” by echolocation. By\nsending out a cry and interpreting the echo, they sense obstacles or potential prey.\n15.10.1 StructureoftheEar\nMost of the ear, the organ of hearing, is hidden from view within the boney skull. It consists\nof three main regions: the outerear, themiddleear and theinnerear (see diagram\n15.9).\n214\nHearing\nFigure161\nDiagram 15.9 - The ear\nTheouter ear consists of anear canal leading inwards to a thin membrane known as\ntheeardrum ortympanic membrane that stretches across the canal. Many animals\nhave an external ear ﬂap or pinna to collect and funnel the sound into the ear canal. The\npinnae (plural of pinna) usually face forwards on the head but many animals can swivel\nthem towards the source of the sound.\nIn dogs the ear canal is long and bent and often traps wax or provides an ideal habitat for\nmites, yeast and bacteria.\nThemiddleear consists of a cavity in the skull that is connected to the pharynx (throat)\nby a long narrow tube called the Eustachian tube . This links the middle ear to the\noutside air so that the air pressure on both sides of the eardrum can be kept the same.\nEveryone knows the uncomfortable feeling (and aﬀected hearing) that occurs when you\ndrive down a steep hill and the unequal air pressures on the two sides of the eardrum cause\nit to distort. The discomfort is relieved when you swallow because the Eustachian tubes\nopen and the pressure on either side equalises.\nWithin the cavity of the middle ear are three of the smallest bones in the body, the auditory\nossicles . They are known as the hammer, the anvil and the stirrup because of their\nresemblance to the shape of these objects. These tiny bones articulate (move against) each\nother and transfer the vibrations of the eardrum to the membrane covering the opening to\nthe inner ear.\nTheinnerear is a complicated series of ﬂuid-ﬁlled tubes imbedded in the bone of the skull.\nIt consists of two main parts. These are the cochlea where sound waves are converted to\nnerve impulses and the vestibularorgan that is associated with the sense of balance and\nhas no role in hearing (see later).\n215\nThe Senses\nThecochlea looks rather like a coiled up snail shell. Within it there are specialised cells\nwith ﬁne hairs on their surface that respond to the movement of the ﬂuid within the cochlea\nby producing nervous impulses that travel to the brain along the auditorynerve .\n15.10.2 HowTheEarHears\nSound waves can be thought of as vibrations in the air. They are collected by the ear pinna\nand pass down the ear canal where they cause the eardrum to vibrate. (An interesting fact\nis that when you are listening to someone speaking your eardrum vibrates at exactly the\nsame rate as the vocal cords of the person speaking to you).\nThe vibration of the eardrum sets the three tiny bones in the middle ear moving against\neach other so that the vibration is transferred to the membrane covering the opening to\nthe inner ear. As well as transferring the vibration, the tiny ear bones also amplify it. The\nthree tiny bones are called the stirrup, anvil, and hammer. They were called such of their\nform. In the human ear this ampliﬁcation is about 20 times while in desert-dwelling animals\nlike the kangaroo rat it is 100 times. This acute hearing warns them of the approach of\npredators like owls and snakes, even in the dark.\nThe vibration causes waves in the ﬂuid in the inner ear that pass down the cochlea. These\nwaves stimulate the tiny hair cells to produce nerve impulses that travel via the auditory\nnerve to the cerebral cortex of the brain where they are interpreted as sound.\nTo summarise: The route sound waves take as they pass through the ear is: Externalear\n|tympanicmembrane|earossicles|innerear|cochlear|haircells\nThe hair cells generate a nerve impulse that travels down the auditory nerve to the brain.\nRemember that sound waves do not pass along the Eustachian tube. Its function is to\nequalise the air pressure on either side of the tympanic membrane."

They\ntell an animal whether it is moving up or down, left or right.

In\ngeneral the nervous system responds rapidly to short-term changes by sending electrical\nimpulses along nerves and the endocrine system brings about longer-term adaptations by\nsending out chemical messengers called hormones into the blood stream.\nFor example, think about what happens when a male and female cat meet under your\nbedroom window at night. The initial response of both cats may include spitting, ﬁghting\nand spine tingling yowling - all brought about by the nervous system. Fear and stress then\nactivates the adrenal glands to secrete the hormone adrenaline which increases the heart\nand respiratory rates. If mating occurs, other hormones stimulate the release of ova from\nthe ovary of the female and a range of diﬀerent hormones maintains pregnancy, delivery of\nthe kittens and lactation."

This\nmechanism is called feedback control. For example, to maintain a constant body tempera-\nture the hypothalamus monitors the blood temperature and initiates processes that increase\nor decrease heat production by the body and loss from the skin so the optimum temperature\nis always maintained.

The\noptimum body temperature is about 37 ￿C [99 ￿F] for mammals, and about 40 ￿C [104 ￿F]\nfor birds. Biochemical processes in the cells, particularly in muscles and the liver, produce\nheat. The heat is distributed through the body by the blood and is lost mainly through the\nskin surface. The production of this heat and its loss through the skin is controlled by the\nhypothalamus in the brain which acts rather like a thermostat on an electric heater. .\n(a) When the body temperature rises above the optimum, a decrease in temperature is\nachieved by:\n•Sweating and panting to increase heat loss by evaporation.\n•Expansion of the blood vessels near the skin surface so heat is lost to the air.\n•Reducing muscle exertion to the minimum.\n(b) When the body temperature falls below the optimum, an increase in temperature can\nbe achieved by:\n•Moving to a heat source e.g. in the sun, out of the wind.\n•Increasing muscular activity\n230\nSummary of Homeostatic Mechanisms\n•Shivering\n•Making the hair stand on end by contraction of the hair erector muscles or ﬂuﬃng of the\nfeathers so there is an insulating layer of air around the body\n•Constricting the blood vessels near the skin surface so heat loss to the air is decreased\n16.14.2 2. Waterbalance\nThe concentration of the body ﬂuids remains relatively constant irrespective of the diet or\nthe quantity of water taken into the body by the animal. Water is lost from the body by\nmany routes (see module 1.6) but the kidney is the main organ that inﬂuences the quantity\nthat is lost. Again it is the hypothalamus that monitors the concentration of the blood\nand initiates the release of hormones from the posterior pituitary gland. These act on the\nkidney tubules to inﬂuence the amount of water (and sodium ions) absorbed from the ﬂuid\nﬂowing along them.\n(a) When the body ﬂuids become too concentrated and the osmotic pressure too high, water\nretention in the kidney tubules can be achieved by:\n•An increased production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary\ngland, which causes more water to be reabsorbed from the kidney tubules.\n•A decreased blood pressure in the glomerulus of the kidney results in less ﬂuid ﬁltering\nthrough into the kidney tubules so less urine is produced.\n(b) When the body ﬂuids become too dilute and the osmotic pressure too low, water loss\nin the urine can be achieved by:\n•A decrease in the secretion of ADH, so less water is reabsorbed from the kidney tubules\nand more diluted urine is produced.\n•An increase in the blood pressure in the glomerulus so more ﬂuid ﬁlters into the kidney\ntubule and more urine is produced.\n•An increase in sweating or panting that also increases the amount of water lost.\nAnother hormone, aldosterone, secreted by the cortex of the adrenal gland, also aﬀects water\nbalance indirectly. It does this by increasing the absorption of sodium ions (Na-) from the\nkidney tubules. This increases water retention since it increases the osmotic pressure of the\nﬂuids around the tubules and water therefore ﬂows out of them by osmosis.\n16.14.3 3. Maintenanceofbloodvolumeaftermoderatebloodloss\nLoss of blood or body ﬂuids leads to decreased blood volume and hence decreased blood\npressure. The result is that the blood system fails to deliver enough oxygen and nutrients\nto the cells, which stop functioning properly and may die. Cells of the brain are particularly\nvulnerable. This condition is known as shock.\nIf blood loss is not extreme, various mechanisms come into play to compensate and ensure\npermanent tissue damage does not occur. These mechanisms include:\n231\nEndocrine System\n•Increased thirst and drinking increases blood volume.\n•Blood vessels in the skin and kidneys constrict to reduce the total volume of the blood\nsystem and hence retain blood pressure.\n•Heart rate increases. This also increases blood pressure.\n•Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is released by the posterior pituitary gland. This increases\nwater re-absorption in the collecting ducts of the kidney tubules so concentrated urine is\nproduced and water loss is reduced. This helps maintain blood volume.\n•Loss of ﬂuid causes an increase in osmotic pressure of the blood. Proteins, mainly albumin,\nreleased into the blood by the liver further increase the osmotic pressure causing ﬂuid\nfrom the tissues to be drawn into the blood by osmosis. This increases blood volume.\n•Aldosterone, secreted by the adrenal cortex, increases the absorption of sodium ions (Na-)\nand water from the kidney tubules. This increases urine concentration and helps retain\nblood volume.\nIf blood or ﬂuid loss is extreme and the blood volume falls by more than 15-25%, the\nabove mechanisms are unable to compensate and the condition of the animal progressively\ndeteriorates. The animal will die unless a vet administers ﬂuid or blood.\n16.14.4 4. Acid/basebalance\nBiochemical reactions within the body are very sensitive to even small changes in acidity\nor alkalinity (i.e. pH) and any departure from the narrow limits disrupts the functioning of\nthe cells. It is therefore important that the blood contains balanced quantities of acids and\nbases.\nThe normal pH of blood is in the range 7.35 to 7.45 and there are a number of mechanisms\nthat operate to maintain the pH in this range. Breathing is one of these mechanisms.\nMuch of the carbon dioxide produced by respiration in cells is carried in the blood as\ncarbonic acid. As the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood increases the blood becomes\nmore acidic and the pH decreases. This is called acidosis and when severe can cause coma\nand death. On the other hand, alkalosis (blood that is too alkaline) causes over stimulation\nof the nervous system and when severe can lead to convulsions and death.\n(a) When vigorous activity generating large quantities of carbon dioxide causes the blood\nto becomes too acidic it can be counteracted in two ways:\n•By the rapid removal of carbon dioxide from the blood by deep, panting breaths\nBy the secretion of hydrogen ions (H+) into the urine by the kidney tubules.\n(b) When over breathing or hyperventilation results in low levels of carbon dioxide in the\nblood and the blood is too alkaline, various mechanisms come into play to bring the pH\nback to within the normal range. These include:\n•A slower rate of breathing\n•A reduction in the amount of hydrogen ions (H+) secreted into the urine.\n232\nWorksheet\n16.14.5 SUMMARY\nHomeostasis is the maintenance of constant conditions within a cell or animal’s body despite\nchanges in the external environment.\nThebody temperature of mammals and birds is maintained at an optimum level by a variety\nof heat regulation mechanisms. These include:\n•Seeking out warm areas,\n•Adjusting activity levels,\nblood vessesl on the body surface,\n•Contraction of the erector muscles so hairs and feathers stand up to form an insulating\nlayer,\n•Shivering,\n•Sweating and panting in dogs.\nAnimals maintain water balance by:\n•adjusting level of antidiuretic hormone(ADH)\n•adjusting level of aldosterone,\n•adjusting blood ﬂow to the kidneys\n•adjusting the amount of water lost through sweating or panting.\nAnimals maintain blood volume after moderate blood loss by:\n•Drinking,\n•Constriction of blood vessels in the skin and kidneys,\n•increasing heart rate,\n•secretion of antidiuretic hormone\n•secretion of aldosterone\n•drawing ﬂuid from the tissues into the blood by increasing the osmotic pressure of the\nblood.\nAnimals maintain the acid/base balance or pH of the blood by:\n•Adjusting the rate of breathing and hence the amount of CO2 removed from the blood.\n•Adjusting the secretion of hydrogen ionsinto the urine."

Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\nlicense document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software\nand other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works. By con-\ntrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your\nfreedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure\nit remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foun-\ndation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software;\nit applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You\ncan apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have\nthe freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them\nif you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want\nit, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free\nprograms, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you\nmodify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\nyou received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get\nthe source code. And you must show them these terms so they know\ntheir rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) oﬀer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and\nauthors’ sake, the GPL requires that modiﬁed versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run mod-\niﬁed versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protect-\ning users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of\nsuch abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which\nis precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed\nthis version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If\nsuch problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to\nextend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL,\nas needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of soft-\nware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it eﬀectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modi-\nﬁcation follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Deﬁnitions.\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds\nof works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this Li-\ncense. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients”\nmay be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of\nan exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modiﬁed version” of the\nearlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodiﬁed Program or a work\nbased on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without per-\nmission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement\nunder applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or\nmodifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution\n(with or without modiﬁcation), making available to the public, and in\nsome countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to\nthe extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible fea-\nture that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the\nuser that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that\nwarranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under\nthis License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the inter-\nface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a\nprominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code.\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modiﬁcations to it. “Object code” means any non-source form\nof a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an oﬃcial\nstandard deﬁned by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces speciﬁed for a particular programming language, one that is\nwidely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Ma-\njor Component”, in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the speciﬁc operating system (if\nany) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce\nthe work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts\nto control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodiﬁed in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface deﬁnition ﬁles associated with source ﬁles for the\nwork, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked\nsubprograms that the work is speciﬁcally designed to require, such as\nby intimate data communication or control ﬂow between those sub-\nprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can re-\ngenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same\nwork. 2. Basic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copy-\nright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated con-\nditions are met. This License explicitly aﬃrms your unlimited per-\nmission to run the unmodiﬁed Program. The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not con-\nvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in\nforce. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modiﬁcations exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\ncontrol copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-\nCircumvention Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an eﬀective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulﬁlling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circum-\nvention is eﬀected by exercising rights under this License with respect\nto the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit opera-\ntion or modiﬁcation of the work as a means of enforcing, against the\nwork’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention\nof technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appro-\npriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep in-\ntact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms\nadded in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all no-\ntices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of\nthis License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you con-\nvey, and you may oﬀer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5.\nConveying Modiﬁed Source Versions.\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modiﬁcations\nto produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n* a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modiﬁed\nit, and giving a relevant date. * b) The work must carry prominent\nnotices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions\nadded under section 7. This requirement modiﬁes the requirement in\nsection 4 to “keep intact all notices”. * c) You must license the entire\nwork, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into pos-\nsession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any\napplicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and\nall its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives\nno permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it. * d) If\nthe work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate\nLegal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that\ndo not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make\nthem do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used\nto limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond\nwhat the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an\naggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of\nthe aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of\nsections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable\nCorresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these\nways:\n* a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (in-\ncluding a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corre-\nsponding Source ﬁxed on a durable physical medium customarily used\nfor software interchange. * b) Convey the object code in, or embodied\nin, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), ac-\ncompanied by a written oﬀer, valid for at least three years and valid\nfor as long as you oﬀer spare parts or customer support for that prod-\nuct model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product\nthat is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium cus-\ntomarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your\nreasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or\n(2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at\nno charge. * c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a\ncopy of the written oﬀer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only\nif you received the object code with such an oﬀer, in accord with sub-\nsection 6b. * d) Convey the object code by oﬀering access from a\ndesignated place (gratis or for a charge), and oﬀer equivalent access to\nthe Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at\nno further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corre-\nsponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the\nobject code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on adiﬀerent server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equiv-\nalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to\nthe object code saying where to ﬁnd the Corresponding Source. Re-\ngardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain\nobligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy\nthese requirements. * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer\ntransmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code\nand Corresponding Source of the work are being oﬀered to the general\npublic at no charge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be in-\ncluded in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorpora-\ntion into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer\nproduct, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a\nparticular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers\nto a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the\nstatus of the particular user or of the way in which the particular\nuser actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A\nproduct is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has\nsubstantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such\nuses represent the only signiﬁcant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, pro-\ncedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modiﬁed versions of a covered work in that User Product\nfrom a modiﬁed version of its Corresponding Source. The information\nmust suﬃce to ensure that the continued functioning of the modiﬁed\nobject code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodiﬁcation has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspeciﬁcally for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a ﬁxed\nterm (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corre-\nsponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by\nthe Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if\nneither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modi-\nﬁed object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been\ninstalled in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include\na requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or up-\ndates for a work that has been modiﬁed or installed by the recipient,\nor for the User Product in which it has been modiﬁed or installed.\nAccess to a network may be denied when the modiﬁcation itself ma-\nterially and adversely aﬀects the operation of the network or violates\nthe rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information pro-\nvided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms.\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Ad-\nditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be\ntreated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that\nthey are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply\nonly to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under\nthose permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this\nLicense without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part\nof it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders\nof that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n* a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability diﬀerently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or * b) Requiring preser-\nvation of speciﬁed reasonable legal notices or author attributions in\nthat material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works\ncontaining it; or * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of\nthat material, or requiring that modiﬁed versions of such material be\nmarked in reasonable ways as diﬀerent from the original version; or *\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or au-\nthors of the material; or * e) Declining to grant rights under trademark\nlaw for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or *\nf) Requiring indemniﬁcation of licensors and authors of that material\nby anyone who conveys the material (or modiﬁed versions of it) with\ncontractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability\nthat these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors\nand authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further re-\nstrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is gov-\nerned by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,\nyou may remove that term. If a license document contains a further\nrestriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you\nmay add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that li-\ncense document, provided that the further restriction does not survive\nsuch relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source ﬁles, a statement of the additional\nterms that apply to those ﬁles, or a notice indicating where to ﬁnd the\napplicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above\nrequirements apply either way. 8. Termination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, un-\nless and until the copyright holder explicitly and ﬁnally terminatesyour license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to no-\ntify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days\nafter the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\npermanently if the copyright holder notiﬁes you of the violation by\nsome reasonable means, this is the ﬁrst time you have received notice\nof violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,\nand you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the\nnotice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having\nCopies.\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run\na copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work oc-\ncurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to\nreceive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing\nother than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify\nany covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept\nthis License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work,\nyou indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic\nLicensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically re-\nceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and prop-\nagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for\nenforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an or-\nganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an orga-\nnization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work\nresults from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who\nreceives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work\nthe party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous\nparagraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of\nthe work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or\ncan get it with reasonable eﬀorts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or aﬃrmed under this License. For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights\ngranted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (in-\ncluding a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any\npatent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, oﬀering for sale, or\nimporting the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents.\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned\nor controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter\nacquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this\nLicense, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do\nnot include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of\nfurther modiﬁcation of the contributor version. For purposes of this\ndeﬁnition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a\nmanner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make,\nuse, sell, oﬀer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propa-\ngate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a\npatent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant\nnot to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license\nto a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to\nenforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\na publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the beneﬁt of the patent\nlicense for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent\nwith the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to\ndownstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual\nknowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the cov-\nered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identiﬁable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrange-\nment, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered\nwork, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the\ncovered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a\nspeciﬁc copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is\nautomatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works\nbased on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the\nscope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the\nnon-exercise of one or more of the rights that are speciﬁcally granted\nunder this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are\na party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business\nof distributing software, under which you make payment to the third\nparty based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and\nunder which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would\nreceive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a)\nin connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or\ncopies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection\nwith speciﬁc products or compilations that contain the covered work,\nunless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was\ngranted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any\nimplied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise\nbe available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of\nOthers’ Freedom.\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\nor otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do\nnot excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot con-\nvey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations\nunder this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a con-\nsequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to\nterms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from\nthose to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy\n255\nLicenses\nboth those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from\nconveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Aﬀero General Public\nLicense.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permis-\nsion to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under\nversion 3 of the GNU Aﬀero General Public License into a single com-\nbined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this Li-\ncense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but\nthe special requirements of the GNU Aﬀero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new ver-\nsions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may diﬀer\nin detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspeciﬁes that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Pub-\nlic License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or\nof any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If\nthe Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General\nPublic License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.\nIf the Program speciﬁes that a proxy can decide which future versions\nof the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public\nstatement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to\nchoose that version for the Program.Later license versions may give you additional or diﬀerent permissions.\nHowever, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copy-\nright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15.\nDisclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EX-\nTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLD-\nERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\n“AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EX-\nPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK\nAS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PRO-\nGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DE-\nFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SER-\nVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR\nAGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\nOR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCI-\nDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF\nTHE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING\nBUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING REN-\nDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR\nTHIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPER-\nATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\nOR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\nOF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above\ncannot be given local legal eﬀect according to their terms, reviewing\ncourts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an abso-\nlute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a\nwarranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program\nin return for a fee.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms\nto Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\nterms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\nattach them to the start of each source ﬁle to most eﬀectively state the\nexclusion of warranty; and each ﬁle should have at least the “copyright”\nline and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<one line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of what it does.>\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at\nyour option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\nWITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty\nof MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PUR-\nPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper\nmail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice\nlike this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program\ncomes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ‘show\nw’. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under\ncertain conditions; type ‘show c’ for details.\nThe hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’ should show the\nappropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your pro-\ngram’s commands might be diﬀerent; for a GUI interface, you would\nuse an “about box”.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nschool, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if nec-\nessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the\nGNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your\nprogram into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine\nlibrary, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary\napplications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the\nGNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But ﬁrst,\nplease read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n18.2 GNUFreeDocumentationLicense\nVersion 1.3, 3 November 2008\nCopyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation,\nInc. <http://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\nlicense document, but changing it is not allowed. 0. PREAMBLE\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nfunctional and useful document ”free” in the sense of freedom: to as-\nsure everyone the eﬀective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or\nwithout modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Sec-\nondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to\nget credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for\nmodiﬁcations made by others.\nThis License is a kind of ”copyleft”, which means that derivative works\nof the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It com-\nplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license\ndesigned for free software.\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free pro-\ngram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this Li-\ncense principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,\nthat contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can\nbe distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work\nunder the conditions stated herein. The ”Document”, below, refers to\nany such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and\nis addressed as ”you”. You accept the license if you copy, modify or\ndistribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\nA ”Modiﬁed Version” of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modiﬁca-\ntions and/or translated into another language.\nA ”Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter sec-\ntion of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of\nthe publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall\nsubject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall\ndirectly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part\na textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\nmathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connec-\ntion with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,\nphilosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\nThe ”Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that\nsays that the Document is released under this License. If a section does\nnot ﬁt the above deﬁnition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be\ndesignated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant\nSections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections\nthen there are none.\nThe ”Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as\nFront-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may\nbe at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\nA ”Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable\ncopy, represented in a format whose speciﬁcation is available to the\ngeneral public, that is suitable for revising the document straightfor-\nwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels)\ngeneric paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing\neditor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic\ntranslation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters.\nA copy made in an otherwise Transparent ﬁle format whose markup,\nor absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage sub-\nsequent modiﬁcation by readers is not Transparent. An image format\nis not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy\nthat is not ”Transparent” is called ”Opaque”.\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input for-\nmat, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-\nconforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human\nmodiﬁcation. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG,\nXCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can\nbe read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or\nXML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally\navailable, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF pro-\nduced by some word processors for output purposes only.\nThe ”Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus\nsuch following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this\nLicense requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats\nwhich do not have any title page as such, ”Title Page” means the text\nnear the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the\nbeginning of the body of the text.\nThe ”publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies of\nthe Document to the public.\nA section ”Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document\nwhose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parenthesesfollowing text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ\nstands for a speciﬁc section name mentioned below, such as ”Acknowl-\nedgements”, ”Dedications”, ”Endorsements”, or ”History”.) To ”Preserve\nthe Title” of such a section when you modify the Document means that\nit remains a section ”Entitled XYZ” according to this deﬁnition.\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice\nwhich states that this License applies to the Document. These War-\nranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\nLicense, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other impli-\ncation that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no\neﬀect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no\nother conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copy-\ning of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\nprinted covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\nDocument’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the\ncopies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:\nFront-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the\nback cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as\nthe publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title\nwith all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add\nother material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited\nto the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and\nsatisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other\nrespects.\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to ﬁt legibly,\nyou should put the ﬁrst ones listed (as many as ﬁt reasonably) on the\nactual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transpar-\nent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque\ncopy a computer-network location from which the general network-\nusing public has access to download using public-standard network\nprotocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added\nmaterial. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably pru-\ndent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,\nto ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the\nstated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute\nan Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\nedition to the public.\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to\ngive them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the\nDocument. 4. MODIFICATIONS\nYou may copy and distribute a Modiﬁed Version of the Document un-\nder the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\nthe Modiﬁed Version under precisely this License, with the Modiﬁed\nVersion ﬁlling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\nand modiﬁcation of the Modiﬁed Version to whoever possesses a copy\nof it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modiﬁed Version:\n* A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title dis-\ntinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of\nthe Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if\nthe original publisher of that version gives permission. * B. List on\nthe Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible\nfor authorship of the modiﬁcations in the Modiﬁed Version, together\nwith at least ﬁve of the principal authors of the Document (all of its\nprincipal authors, if it has fewer than ﬁve), unless they release you\nfrom this requirement. * C. State on the Title page the name of the\npublisher of the Modiﬁed Version, as the publisher. * D. Preserve\nall the copyright notices of the Document. * E. Add an appropriate\ncopyright notice for your modiﬁcations adjacent to the other copyright\nnotices. * F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license\nnotice giving the public permission to use the Modiﬁed Version under\nthe terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n* G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\nand required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. *\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License. * I. Preserve the section\nEntitled ”History”, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at\nleast the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modiﬁed Ver-\nsion as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled ”History”\nin the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and pub-\nlisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item\ndescribing the Modiﬁed Version as stated in the previous sentence. *\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\npublic access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the\nnetwork locations given in the Document for previous versions it was\nbased on. These may be placed in the ”History” section. You may omit\na network location for a work that was published at least four years\nbefore the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it\nrefers to gives permission. * K. For any section Entitled ”Acknowledge-\nments” or ”Dedications”, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve\nin the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor ac-\nknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. * L. Preserve all\nthe Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text andin their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered\npart of the section titles. * M. Delete any section Entitled ”Endorse-\nments”. Such a section may not be included in the Modiﬁed Version.\n* N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ”Endorsements”\nor to conﬂict in title with any Invariant Section. * O. Preserve any\nWarranty Disclaimers.\nIf the Modiﬁed Version includes new front-matter sections or appen-\ndices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied\nfrom the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of\nthese sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of\nInvariant Sections in the Modiﬁed Version’s license notice. These titles\nmust be distinct from any other section titles.\nYou may add a section Entitled ”Endorsements”, provided it con-\ntains nothing but endorsements of your Modiﬁed Version by various\nparties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative deﬁnition of a\nstandard.\nYou may add a passage of up to ﬁve words as a Front-Cover Text,\nand a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end\nof the list of Cover Texts in the Modiﬁed Version. Only one passage\nof Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by\n(or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document\nalready includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by\nyou or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on\nbehalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one,\non explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old\none.\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this Li-\ncense give permission to use their names for publicity for or to as-\nsert or imply endorsement of any Modiﬁed Version. 5. COMBINING\nDOCUMENTS\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under\nthis License, under the terms deﬁned in section 4 above for modiﬁed\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the In-\nvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodiﬁed, and list\nthem all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license\nnotice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\ncopy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name\nbut diﬀerent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original au-\nthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant\nSections in the license notice of the combined work.\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ”History”\nin the various original documents, forming one section Entitled ”His-\ntory”; likewise combine any sections Entitled ”Acknowledgements”, and\nany sections Entitled ”Dedications”. You must delete all sections En-\ntitled ”Endorsements”. 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other doc-\numents released under this License, and replace the individual copies\nof this License in the various documents with a single copy that is\nincluded in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this\nLicense for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other\nrespects.\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and dis-\ntribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy\nof this License into the extracted document, and follow this License\nin all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7.\nAGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\nand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium, is called an ”aggregate” if the copyright resulting\nfrom the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the com-\npilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the\nDocument is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to\nthe other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative\nworks of the Document.\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies\nof the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the\nentire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on cov-\ners that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic\nequivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise\nthey must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n8. TRANSLATION\nTranslation is considered a kind of modiﬁcation, so you may distribute\ntranslations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing\nInvariant Sections with translations requires special permission from\ntheir copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all\nInvariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invari-\nant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the\nlicense notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, pro-\nvided that you also include the original English version of this License\nand the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a\ndisagreement between the translation and the original version of this\nLicense or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled ”Acknowledgements”, ”Dedi-\ncations”, or ”History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title(section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMI-\nNATION\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt oth-\nerwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, un-\nless and until the copyright holder explicitly and ﬁnally terminates\nyour license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to no-\ntify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days\nafter the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\npermanently if the copyright holder notiﬁes you of the violation by\nsome reasonable means, this is the ﬁrst time you have received notice\nof violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,\nand you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the\nnotice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does\nnot give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS\nLICENSE\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions\nof the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such\nnew versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but\nmay diﬀer in detail to address new problems or concerns. See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\nIf the Document speciﬁes that a particular numbered version of this\nLicense ”or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that speciﬁed version or\nof any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\nFree Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published\n(not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document\nspeciﬁes that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License\ncan be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version\npermanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.\n11. RELICENSING\n”Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or ”MMC Site”) means any\nWorld Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also\nprovides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public\nwiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A ”Massive\nMultiauthor Collaboration” (or ”MMC”) contained in the site means\nany set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\n”CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike\n3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-\nproﬁt corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,\nCalifornia, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published\nby that same organization.\n”Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or\nin part, as part of another Document.\nAn MMC is ”eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this License,\nand if all works that were ﬁrst published under this License somewhere\nother than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in\npart into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and\n(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in\nthe site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August\n1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. ADDENDUM:\nHow to use this License for your documents\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy\nof the License in the document and put the following copyright and\nlicense notices just after the title page:\nCopyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU\nFree Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version pub-\nlished by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections,\nno Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license\nis included in the section entitled ”GNU Free Documentation License”.\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover\nTexts, replace the ”with … Texts.” line with this:\nwith the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\nFront-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being\nLIST.\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other\ncombination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the sit-\nuation.\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\nrecommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of\nfree software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to per-\nmit their use in free software.\n256\nGNU Lesser General Public License\n18.3 GNULesserGeneralPublicLicense\nGNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\nlicense document, but changing it is not allowed.\nThis version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates\nthe terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public Li-\ncense, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below. 0.\nAdditional Deﬁnitions.\nAs used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the\nGNU General Public License.\n“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other\nthan an Application or a Combined Work as deﬁned below.\nAn “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Deﬁn-\ning a subclass of a class deﬁned by the Library is deemed a mode of\nusing an interface provided by the Library.\nA “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library. The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked\nVersion”.\nThe “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source\ncode for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation,\nare based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means\nthe object code and/or source code for the Application, including any\ndata and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work\nfrom the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Com-\nbined Work. 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 2. Conveying\nModiﬁed Versions.\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modiﬁcations, a fa-\ncility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that\nuses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility\nis invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modiﬁed version:\n* a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith eﬀort to\nensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function\nor data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its\npurpose remains meaningful, or * b) under the GNU GPL, with none\nof the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header ﬁle that is part of the Library. You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated ma-\nterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts\nand accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or\nfewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License. * b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU\nGPL and this license document.\n4. Combined Works.You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, eﬀectively do not restrict modiﬁcation of the portions\nof the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineer-\ning for debugging such modiﬁcations, if you also do each of the follow-\ning:\n* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work\nthat the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\ncovered by this License. * b) Accompany the Combined Work with a\ncopy of the GNU GPL and this license document. * c) For a Com-\nbined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include\nthe copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a\nreference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this\nlicense document. * d) Do one of the following: o 0) Convey the\nMinimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and\nthe Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under\nterms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application\nwith a modiﬁed version of the Linked Version to produce a modiﬁed\nCombined Work, in the manner speciﬁed by section 6 of the GNU\nGPL for conveying Corresponding Source. o 1) Use a suitable shared\nlibrary mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism\nis one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present\non the user’s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a\nmodiﬁed version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the\nLinked Version. * e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you\nwould otherwise be required to provide such information under section\n6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\nnecessary to install and execute a modiﬁed version of the Combined\nWork produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a\nmodiﬁed version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the\nInstallation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding\nSource and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1,\nyou must provide the Installation Information in the manner speciﬁed\nby section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n5. Combined Libraries.You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library\nside by side in a single library together with other library facilities that\nare not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey\nsuch a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of\nthe following:\n* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\nbased on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\nconveyed under the terms of this License. * b) Give prominent no-\ntice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the\nLibrary, and explaining where to ﬁnd the accompanying uncombined\nform of the same work.\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new ver-\nsions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but\nmay diﬀer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library\nas you received it speciﬁes that a certain numbered version of the GNU\nLesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you\nhave the option of following the terms and conditions either of that\npublished version or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version\nnumber of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose\nany version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Library as you received it speciﬁes that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License\nshall apply, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of any ver-\nsion is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n257"
