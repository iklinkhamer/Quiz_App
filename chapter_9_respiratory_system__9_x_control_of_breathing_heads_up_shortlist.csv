"In the circulatory system, why does an increase in cardiac output cause an increase in volume flow rate (of blood)? Because:",an increased cardiac output causes vasoconstriction.,as cardiac output increases so blood viscosity increases.,"as cardiac output increases, the resistance of the systemic circulation to blood flow decreases.",cardiac output and volume flow rate are the same thing,D,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter 9 - Respiratory System,0.999,Chapter 9 - Respiratory System,"blood, flow, in, increase, of, rate, system, volume",chapter_9::9_x_control_of_breathing_heads_up,9.x Control of Breathing (Heads-up),0.998,chapter_9::9_x_control_of_breathing_heads_up; chapter_10::10_2_lymphatic_system_heads_up; chapter_9::9_3_diffusion_transport_of_oxygen_heads_up,"blood, in, of, rate, system"
What effect is achieved by having an arteriole that supplies blood and another that drains blood from the glomerulus?,oxygen rich blood can be supplied to the nephron after blood leaves the glomerulus,the blood pressure within the glomerulus can be manipulated.,reabsorption of water and nutrients from the ﬁ ltrate is facilitated.,the concentration gradient within the kidney’s medulla can be maintained.,B,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter 9 - Respiratory System,0.982,Chapter 9 - Respiratory System; Chapter 16 - Endocrine System; Chapter 1 - Chemicals; Chapter 10 - Lymphatic System,"REGEX:\b(glomerul\w+|tubul\w+|nephron)\b, and, blood, by, is, suppli",chapter_9::9_x_control_of_breathing_heads_up,9.x Control of Breathing (Heads-up),0.991,chapter_9::9_x_control_of_breathing_heads_up; chapter_1::1_2_elements_and_atoms_heads_up,"REGEX:\b(glomerul\w+|tubul\w+|nephron)\b, and, blood, by, is"
