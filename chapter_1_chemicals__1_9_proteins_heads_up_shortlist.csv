Why does perspiring cause heat energy to be lost from the body? Because:,"being at a lower temperature than the skin, sweat cools skin by conduction.",evaporating water molecules remove heat in the form of their own kinetic energy.,the presence of sweat on the skin prevents infra-red radiation being absorbed.,sweat on the skin allows heat to be lost to the air by conduction.,B,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter 1 - Chemicals,0.981,Chapter 1 - Chemicals,"bodi, energi, from, heat, the, the bodi, to",chapter_1::1_9_proteins_heads_up,1.9 Proteins (Heads-up),0.911,chapter_1::1_9_proteins_heads_up; chapter_2::2_5_the_animal_kingdom_heads_up,"from, heat, to"
